Aristotle's writes in justification of Slavery 
>[!quote] For that some should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule.

>[!bug] Conclusion
>- His justification should not be taken as philosophical view but it was out of necessities of time; he was setting the ground for emancipation of slaves.
