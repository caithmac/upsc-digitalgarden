# Welcome! ðŸŒ±
I am a student on a journey to UPSC. Please come along. 

[[UPSC/Mains Syllabus|Mains Syllabus]] from here you can dive into various subjects and how I am going through them.  You can go to [[About|About]] to know me! 

I will be pushing changes twice a week, or when some very important things have taken place.  If you see any spelling mistake, just ignore it. I have turned off my spell check, it breaks my flow while writing. 
If you find any mistake in the notes(conceptual, data, etc), there is a good chance I will be coming back to it and fixing it. 
Are all my notes here? Currently, no. In future, maybe. Except Geography. I have handwritten OneNote notes and will be referring to them. This is a work in progress.
