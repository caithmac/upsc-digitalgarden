##### What to read and why? 


_Why did the government impose a special additional excise duty on export of petrol and diesel? And implications of the move ._

With an aim to address the issue of fuel shortage in the country, the government Friday imposed special additional excise duty on export of petrol and diesel.
The move will not just fetch more revenue to the exchequer but also discourage companies from exporting petrol and diesel, and thereby help ease the fuel situation in the domestic market.
