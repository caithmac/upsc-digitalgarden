>[!error] Introduction
>Bipin Chandra has said that unlike China, India didn't start with clean slate. India had multitude of factors which affected and are reflected in the Indian constitution. The dominant external as well as internal factors have been the hegemonic power of UK and USA and the struggle for Independence for over a century. 



>[!done] Body 

Indian constitution has been called bags of borrowings. It is common criticism that it has heavily borrowed from UK and USA and many other countries. It suggest that Indian constitution is not original and is patchwork of ideas and principle borrowed from other sources.

Another influence was the India's long drawn Indian independence. It saw many freedom fighters with varied point of view on how to run India. The ideals of democracy, and formation of free, just and equitable society for people of India finds space in Indian constitution. Such as in Article 343(1) where in talks about Hindi shall be the official language in Devanagari script it vindicates Bal Gangadhar Tilak's ideas. Or  article 40 that talks about organization of  Gram Panchayat in Part IV of CoI was idea of Gandhi. 

Internal factors also played key role in forming of Indian constitution. One of the most significant one was the diversity of India's population and there was need in front of constitution drafters to keep all the varied population united and not leave behind anyone. 
This led to many provision in the constitution that talks and work toward inclusion.  Such as article 14, which provides for right to equality to every citizen. Or the inclusion of Article 16 and 17, which works on affirmative action to emancipate women and remove evil of untouchability. 

Gandhi held that "one should keep the window of house open and door closed. Let the winds around the world come to house, but it should not blow off my feet."

>[!tip] Conclusion 
>Overall, the Indian Constitution was shaped by a combination of external and internal factors, including the legal and political systems of other countries, the ideals of the Indian independence movement, and the need to address the diversity of India's population.
