##### Liberty and Equality as opposed to each other
- Ideas given by [[UPSC/Classic Liberalism|Classic Liberalism]] which believe the two value are opposite to each other. 
- Lord Acton and Alexis de Tocqueville; Liberty and equality are antithetical. They believed that desire of equality will destroy the possibility of liberty. 
- The idea of free market and open competion and invisible hand result in a benevolent and progressive outcome tho unequal. 
- They believed that any attempt to remove inequality will involve considerable social and political intervention eventually interfering with individual and his private exercise for freedom. 
- No individual will voluntarily give up its wealth and privileges therefore forceful intervention becomes a compulsory phenomena. It is the wrong for the state to interfere in life and liberty of citizens. 
- Programmes to secure social equality will require massive social and political regulation eventually culminating the state into a totalitarian and authroritian regime. 
- This theory has been supported by Nozzick, Bagehot, Hayek,, Friedman, Mosca, Spencer and Pareto
