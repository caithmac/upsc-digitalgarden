Kelkar Task Force on indirect taxes in 2003 and was long in the making

It is this working together that has made India stand out now as the fastest growing economy, as projected by many, this year and the next.
quasi-federal nature of Indian polity wherein both the Centre and the states enjoyed independent powers of taxation demanded a unique solution. States of different sizes and at different stages of development with their legacy tax systems had to be brought together under the GS
he GST Council, the constitutional body, and a GST solution unique to India (dual GST) were the answers found to such a demand. With a few exceptions, taxes, both of the Centre and the states, were subsumed in the GST. Seventeen different laws were merged and a single taxation system was brought in through the GST.
