>[!Error] Introduction

>[!done] Body 

Pareto was the first who cane up with the term, 'elite' and 'masses' to indicate superior or inferior groups in society.  It was further supported by Mosca who theorised that the people are necessarily divided into two groups: the rulers and rules.

Aristotle's writes in justification of Slavery 
>[!quote] For that some should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule.

^033a14

>[!cite] Each man is an end in itself. No one ought to be treat other person as a means to an end. 
>~ Immanuel Kant

>[!cite] What is, should not determine what ought to be rather it should be vice-versa. 



>[!bug] Conclusion
>- His justification should not be taken as philosophical view but it was out of necessities of time; he was setting the ground for emancipation of slaves. 
>- According to Barker: Aristotle's conception of slavery is more a justification of necessity than a deduction from disinterested observation of facts.

And the rules are not competent to replace it. 
Michel proposed his famous "iron law of oligarchy" - which implied that whatever institution there is - it turns into oligarchy. That is rule of few. 
Several scholars developed the idea of democratic elitism. 

Karl Mannheim argued that we don't give up democracy by giving the policy shaping activity to Elites. No, we still hold the power to vote them out, when our aspirations do not match with those of a set of elites.
And that is enough for democracy to survive. 
Schumpeter argued that one should see the form of government, not on the basis of who is ruling, but how the ruler is appointed and more importantly removed. So it doesn't mean that will of people come in effect, rather role is limited to choosing between elites who are competing. It also doesn't allow the elites to absolute power. 

Satori says that the elites ruling is not imperfection of democratic setup, rather it is the demand. He says that any demand for self governed people is delusional. That the government is business of contempt class, which elites are.  And the danger emanating from democracy is not the presence of leadership, rather the absence of it, which would result in the mass being exploited by anti-democratic counter elites.
