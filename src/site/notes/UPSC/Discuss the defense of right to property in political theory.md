 >[!done] Body 

[[UPSC/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]] believed that state was created for safety of man's life and property. 
[[UPSC/John Locke\|John Locke]] postulated that man's right to "life, liberty and property" was a fundamental right and that state was created for protection of these rights, echoing Hobbes idea. He believes that right to property is fruit of labour. 
[[UPSC/Rousseau\|Rousseau]] states that right to property is an essential element of civil liberty provided by the state.
[[UPSC/Adam Smith\|Adam Smith]] and [[UPSC/Bentham\|Bentham]] expressed that private property was an essential instrument of social progress and it compromised the very foundation of market economy and the capitalist system. 
Every liberal political theorist regarded possession of property as a proof of individuals state in the state. 
Modern Liberal diverges from the early liberal theory, and do not regard property as sacred or absolute right to private property. 
[[UPSC/T H Green\|T H Green]] argued that right to property is an instrument to exercise moral freedom, but he pleaded for reasonable restriction on right of property in the interest of social good. 




>[!tip] Conclusion
>However, since the advent of [[Industrial Revolution\|Industrial Revolution]] and thereafter concentration of wealth in fewer and fewer hands, there has been realization that property has become a means of control over other's life and labour.
