#### Are there fundamental crisis tendencies in the modern democractic welfare state. Discuss with reference to habbermasian idea of legitamacy crisis (20marks)

>[!error] Introduction
>  Habermas in his book, "Legitamacy Crisis" has talked about how the capitalist societies are in crisis tendencies. These crisis tendencies emerge  because of fundamental contradiction between capitalist nature of accumulation and pressure of  welfarist nature of democaractic politics.

>[!done] Body 1 :  Habbermasian Idea of Legitamacy 
>What :  Cycle of Legitamacy and Welfarism 

- According to Habermas: 
- In modern capitalist society, legitimacy is obtained by democratic methods, which leads to more demand by people for more social welfarism, increase of popular participation and social equality. 
- This puts pressure on state to cast wider net to expand its social responsibilities and state intervention for removing inequality. But this all comes at cost and and state has to increase its expenditure on welfare program.
- This increased expenditure has to be borne by someone, hence this extra burden is passed on to the tax payers. Which restricts their spending and thus lowering the profits of capitalists and accumulation. 
- Thus the capitalist society is constantly in the grip of crisis tendency that is legitimacy.


>[!done] Body 2 : Are there fundamental crisis tendencies in the modern democractic welfare state? 
>Answer : Yes,
>How : Connection to Body 1 
>Examples : Arab Spring, Purple Revolution, Iran Hijab controversy 

- As the liberal democracies have to juggle between the profits of capitalists and welfare of people. Many a times it find itself in pinch. 
- When the state is not able to satiate the peoples demand for social, political and economic welfare, people protest, revolt and ultimately overthrow the system.
- As aptly said by Aristotle,  that feeling of inequality howsoever real or imagined is cause of revolution. 
- The provision which people demand are basic feature of social contract of liberal democracy and its people. 
- If the state is not able to fulfil this basic task, it loses people's confidence and consent. 
- Which come out in form of protest and civil unrest. 

> [!done] Body 3: Contemproary example
>  Arab Spring : 
>  Two options : 
>  	Charismatic Leaders - in  hope for better future of depalated people
>  	Civil Societies - welfare state or all out revolution. 

- This phenomena is no where better captured than the Arab Spring. It gripped the imagination of North African people and West Asia. Many European countries are also glaring example of this phenomena, 
- This civil unrest can lead to two paths. 
- The first path being, there will be rise of popular leaders who with the help of masses resurrect the society. A leader who rules by conforming to populist demands, vote bank politics and works on rhetoric and exclusionism of minority voices. 
- This can be seen in the rise of leaders like Giorgia Meloni, Recep Erdogan, and erstwhile leaders of Brazil and Hungary. 
- The second path can be formation of civil societies which can work to remove said inequalities and work on welfarism. 
- But this could lead to total revolution, whose result is hard to predict, few state can come out stronger while other state may crumble and never stand up on their legs. 

>[!tip] Conclusion 
>Hence, to maintain legitamacy state has to work to build trust among citizens.  Elections are the best way to seek legitamacy. They can also gauge legitamacy by voter turnout in the disturbed areas. 
>Similiarly, inclusive legislations, effictive execution and independent adjudication is another way state can maintain their legitamacy.
