Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central authority and constituent political units, such as states or provinces. In India, the Constitution establishes a federal system of government, with the central government and the states each having their own spheres of authority and jurisdiction. However, the distribution of powers between the central government and the states is not always clearly defined, and there have been instances where the central government has exercised more control over the states, leading some to argue that India functions more like a unitary state in practice.

One factor that can contribute to the central government appearing to exercise more control over the states is the presence of emergency powers, which allow the central government to take over the administration of a state in times of crisis. The central government has declared a state of emergency several times in India's history, and these periods have been marked by an increase in the central government's control over the states.

Additionally, the central government has the power to promulgate certain types of legislation that are applicable to the entire country, such as the Union List and the Concurrent List. This can lead to the central government having a greater influence over the states in certain areas of policy.

Overall, while India is a federal system of government, there are certain features that can make it appear more unitary in practice. However, it is important to note that the federal structure of the government is an important aspect of India's political system and is meant to balance the powers of the central government with those of the states.


Are there any quotes from scholars about it

There are many quotes from scholars about the functioning of federalism in India and the ways in which it may appear more unitary in practice. Here are a few examples:

1.  "The Constitution of India has created a federal system of government with a strong centre, and in practice, it has often functioned as a quasi-federal system or even as a unitary system, depending on the political circumstances of the time." - Sudhir Krishnaswamy, Professor of Law at National Law School of India University
    
2.  "The federal structure of the Indian Constitution has often been described as 'quasi-federal,' with the centre holding a preponderance of power and the states being relegated to a largely secondary role. The centre has used its emergency powers on several occasions to take over the administration of states, and the central government's power to legislate on a wide range of subjects has allowed it to exert a significant influence over state policy." - Pratap Bhanu Mehta, Indian political commentator and academic
    
3.  "India's federal structure is often described as a 'co-operative federalism,' in which the central and state governments work together to address common problems and challenges. However, in practice, the central government has often exercised a greater degree of control over the states, leading some to argue that India functions more like a unitary state." - Sujit Choudhry, Professor of Law and Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley
    

These are just a few examples of the many quotes that have been written about the functioning of federalism in India. It is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been the subject of much discussion and debate among scholars and political analysts.
