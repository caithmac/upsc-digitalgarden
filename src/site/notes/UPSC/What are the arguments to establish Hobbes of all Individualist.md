Hobbes had accepted the discrete, egoistic, self-interested, atomistic. individual as the building block of his all powerful state. 
He derives his individualism by rejecting, divine theory of King, and self evident truth. He accepted material and physical realities. 
The individual had the right to:
1. Private Space 
	- Thoughts 
	- Economic Activities
As Sabine had pointed, "His individuals were post-medieval men of the early capitalist society, independent and essentially masterless. "
The individuals didn't get subsumed or merged in the all powerful state. If the individual felt threatened, then the Leviathan lost the rationale to exercise. Society was a cooperative enterprise as long as the individuals saw it as necessary for their well-being and benefit.  He emphasized the element of consent was the basis of legitimate regulation of human affairs, as a yardstick for independence and choice in society.
Undoubtedly, Hobbes was the greatest and most consistent individualist.
