# What is UCC 
- European concept 
- Universal citizenship 
- Guiding theme protection of minority and to protect them from any sort of discrimination.
- State will adopt the principle of religious neutrality. 
- The idea of UCC gets linked with 
	- Idea of secularism 
	- Idea of Nationalism 

### Why it appears uniform 
- Since the laws being made are according to constitution whenever state makes law for any community has to be aligned with value of constitution. 
- Hence they appear uniform. 

### What are the issues in India context 
- Gender justice
- Secularism 
- Nationalism 
- However the most important concern is gender justice or rights of muslim women. 

### Approach of constituent assembly 
- Highly divisive issue 
- Hansa Mehta, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, Nehru and Ambedkar prefered UCC 
- Rajendar Prasad and Sardar Patel and leaders from minority were against 

### Provision of Constition 
- [[Article 44.\|Article 44.]] of [[UPSC/Directive Principle of State Policy\|Directive Principle of State Policy]] 
- State SHALL endeavor to secure for citizens a ucc throughout territory of India. 
	- Because there was lack of trust hence it was not conducive to introduce UCC. 

### Present Condition 
- Growth of distrust rather trust. 

### Whether state in India can intervene in personal laws of minority. 
- UC is a directive a non enforceable part of constitution
- Article 25 ( 1) it gives all person freedom of conscience practice profess and propagate religion
- Custom and tradition are part of freedom to practice religion

### explanation
- [[Article 25. Freedom of Conscience and Free Profession, Practice and Propagation of Religion\|Article 25. Freedom of Conscience and Free Profession, Practice and Propagation of Religion]] not absolute right it is subjected to restriction
	- public order
	- Morality
	- Health
	- Other provision of Part 3
- article 25 clause 2 section A: nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the state from making law regulating restricting any economic financial political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice

### emergence of recent debate on UC
- the recent debate goes back to shahbanu phase 1985
- Supreme Court had upheld the order which had permitted Muslim women to get maintenance at parvath Hindus as per section 125 of CRPC 
- Supreme Court also directed the introduction of UCC
### respond of government
- Muslim protection of right on divorce act 1986
- Section 3(1)(a)
	- reasonable and fair provision and maintenance to be made to women within idat period
- Section 3(1)(b)
	- where she herself maintains the children wants to before or after divorce a fair provision of maintenance provided by former husband for a period of two years from respective date of birth of such children
- Section 3(1)(c)
	- husband has to give complete amount of mayor or dowry agreed at the time of marriage
- Section(1)(d)
	- all property given to women in marriage either by relative or of woman or husband no

**and there are many more provisions which need not be studied here**

#### Daniel latifi case 2001
- was the lawyer of shaabanu challenged the validity of the act
- Supreme Court has upheld the validity of the act
- However Supreme Court held that woman is entitled to maintenance beyond idat period.
- maintenance has to be fair and reasonable it can be done in installment or lump sum
- Right for Muslim women under CRPC 125 suspend only when she has received fair and reasonable compensation as per section three of protection of Muslim women rights on divorce act 

### recent controversy

- triple talaq judgment on 22nd August 2017 Supreme Court dealt with five petition on triple talaq filed in 2016
- Judgment
	- it was quite complex
	- Two judges found it complex arbitrary unconstitutional next delete that
	- Third judge found it unislamic and not part of shariat
	- The remaining 2 judge held that it was integral part of personal law which is fundamental right protected by constitution
- however these two judges laid down injunction against the practice for six months and directed the government to come up with law by then

### Status for triple Talaq 
- majority judgment considered it unconstitutional and thus put on hold
- Government to come up with until government comes up with law injunction will continue
### government response
- judgment had created confusion as if that Supreme Court has directed the government to bring law
- This was how it was projected by media 
- However there was no such direction government introduced triple talaq bill in Lok Sabha
- There is no opposition to banned triple talaq but disagreement over the provision of bill

### Present Situation of UCC 
- the government has deferred lower Commission and ask for recommendation
- Law Commission was to give in 2018
- Supreme Court had admitted new case
- Sameena Begum versus union of India case 2018
- since matter is subjudice low Commission has postponed this

### Way forward 
- it is a European concept emerged on 17th century may not be suitable for India which is subcontinental quality in 21st century
- Even Western countries are moving toward the idea of multicultural citizenship
- India is a federation the purpose of federation is to accommodate family marriage and such law are a matter of concurrent  list
- putting this matter give option to state to have their own law in accordance to their local traditions and customs
- In India there can't be UC because some tribal communities are allowed to have customary law
- UCCS debate doesn't have linkage with the idea of nationalism the importance of UC is in context of gender justice
- UC in practical sense means Indian state getting opportunity in personal law
- No Muslim personal law shariat application law 1937 district St from interfering in Muslim personal law but it has not really stopped Indian state
- judiciary is also an organ of state with subsequent judgment triple talaq case judiciary also has addressed concern of Muslim women
- Nothing wrong if present government aims to reform the way Ambedkar introduced Hindu code bill but any such bill needs confidence building measure
- however it is also true that simply forming Muslim personal law wouldn't improve the status of women's multidimensional approach is neededq
