Revolution for Aristotle is simply is transformation in the nature and organization of state. 
Complete change of type of government and incremental changes in nature that is both big and small changes are revolution for him. 
For Aristotle the causes are 
1. Apart from mentioning regime specific causes he pays special focus on feeling of inequality born out of privilege and entitlement of the ruling classes. 
2. Aristotle doesn't promote revolution since it creates instability in a well ordered state. His idea of revolution is the manifestation of maxim of golden mean since he is balancing between completely conserving or completely overthrowing. 
3. In fact he suggest means to avoid revolution among all the ways he suggest he lays special emphasis on countering the discontent arising due to inequality and also focuses on education of constitution and inculcation of discipline 

Aristotle is one of most holistic thinker of revolution because not only he describe diverse causes of revolution as per different type of government but also entails detailed method to prevent them. His focus of inequality as a cause would be reflected by one of the greatest thinker of revolution Karl Marx hundred years of later.
