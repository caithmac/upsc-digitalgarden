The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a turning point in world history and had a profound impact on international politics. Some of the key impacts include:

1.  End of the Cold War: The Soviet Union was the main rival of the West, and its collapse marked the end of the 45-year long Cold War and reduced tensions between the East and West.
    
2.  Rise of the United States as the sole superpower: The collapse of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower in the world, leading to a unipolar international system dominated by the US.
    
3.  Spread of democracy and capitalism: The collapse of the Soviet Union led to the spread of democracy and capitalism, with many former communist states transitioning to market-oriented economies and democratic systems of government.
    
4.  Changes in the international security architecture: The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union led to changes in the international security architecture, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact being dissolved and new security organizations being formed.
    
5.  Repercussions on the Middle East and Afghanistan: The collapse of the Soviet Union had far-reaching implications for the Middle East and Afghanistan, with the US and its allies becoming more involved in the region and the emergence of new security challenges.
    

In conclusion, the collapse of the Soviet Union was a seminal moment in world history and had far-reaching impacts on international politics. The end of the Cold War, the rise of the US as the sole superpower, the spread of democracy and capitalism, changes in the international security architecture, and the repercussions on the Middle East and Afghanistan are just a few of the key impacts of the collapse of the Soviet Union on international politics.
