# Plato's Feminism
#### Argument: 

##### First feminist 
- Men and Women were allowed to be in any class. 
- Made mandotry for women's consent. 
- In his [[UPSC/Theory of Education|Theory of Education]] all kids are allowed to take state sponsored education. 
- Greek was stratified; women condition was poor, he didn't make any special reference to women; hence treating them same as everybody. 

##### Not feminist; accidental feminist. 
- He failed to mention women. 
- Generally meant men. 
- Accidently left women. 
-  ***I thank God that I was born Greek and not barbarian, freeman and not slave, man and not woman; but above all, that I was born in the age of Socrates***
- Hard to believe that he made such big mistake; Women condition was bad. (Opposition of above argument)
