The civil liberty movement in India refers to the efforts by individuals and organizations to protect and promote civil liberties in the country. These liberties include freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom of association, and the right to privacy, among others.

The civil liberty movement in India has a long history, dating back to the struggle for independence from British rule. During the colonial period, many Indians fought for the right to self-determination and freedom from British rule, and this struggle was often associated with the civil liberty movement.

After independence, the civil liberty movement in India has focused on issues such as protecting the rights of marginalized groups, including women, Dalits, and tribal communities, and ensuring that the government respects the rights of its citizens.

There are many organizations and individuals in India that are actively involved in the civil liberty movement, including human rights organizations, legal organizations, and grassroots activists. These groups often work together to raise awareness about civil liberties issues and to advocate for change through legal action, lobbying, and public campaigns.

Overall, the civil liberty movement in India is an important force for promoting and protecting the rights of all citizens in the country.
