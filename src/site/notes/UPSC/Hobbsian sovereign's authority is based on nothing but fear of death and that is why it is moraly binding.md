For Hobbes the state of nature is simple to define since it lacks government and there is omnipresent danger to life. As long as a mutually  and morally binding agreement does not take place individuals are destined to live a life of perpetual fear and violence. Hobbes says "The wickedness of bad man also compels good man to have recourse, for their own protection, through virtue of war, which are violence and fraud."
For Hobbes, covenants are the only way out of this diabolical situation, since untill all agree to lay down arms life and liberty of everyone will be in danger. This can be only ensured by mutually and morally binding contract of one with all and all with one.  
Role of fear of death in contract, in the state of nature of Hobbes ensure that the first right any individual will seek will be right to prevent violent death. For Hobbes, individuals don't just have rights to ensure self preservation but also to judge what will ensure self preservation. And the hobbesian Individual rarely makes a correct judgement also we are not in a position in the state of nature to trust others judgement regarding our self preservation due to lack of mutual trust. We can be judges in our case but in this state the stakes are very high, life and death. In the state of nature we have right to all things even on anothers body. This dramatic point indicates that unless there is some share authority life eventually end via dangerous and deadly conflict. Hobbesian advice is an advice of prudence, you want to violent death you avoid state of nature in conclusion [[UPSC/The Leviathan|The Leviathan]]'s birth is premised on two logic 
1. Violent death is what we fear the most 
2. Only an accountable sovereign is what stands between us and that violent death. 
By focusin solely on the death and threat to life of individual fear becomes the prime motivator for creation of [[UPSC/The Leviathan|The Leviathan]]
