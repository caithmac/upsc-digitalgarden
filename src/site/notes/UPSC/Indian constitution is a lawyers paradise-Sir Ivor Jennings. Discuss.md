The Indian Constitution is often referred to as a "lawyer's paradise" because of its length and complexity. It is one of the longest and most detailed constitutions in the world, with over 450 articles and 12 schedules. This complexity allows lawyers to find numerous provisions and interpretations to support their arguments, making it a rich source of legal discussion and debate.
