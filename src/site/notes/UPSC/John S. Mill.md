##### Revision of Utilitarianism
- Mill rejects psychological egoism - hedonism, and identified happiness in both of the forms, intellectual and sensual. 
- We have sense of dignity which makes us intellectual pleasure to sensual one.. 
- Principle of  utility must include motive character, trait of agent. In justification of agent, motive of action is equally important. 
- Pleasure is not only quantative but qualitative too. 
- Human beings are not only looking forward for their own interest but serve interest of other. 
- Human nature is self centered and altruistic. 
- Human nature not only enjoys self pleasure but ready to sacrifice himself. In this context only, Mill stated "It is better to be human being dissatisfied than pig satisfied, better to be Socrates dissatisfied than fool satisfied."
- Mill improved [[UPSC/Bentham|Bentham]] idea that Human being is only seeking pleasure as ultimate goal of life self realization through self development.
