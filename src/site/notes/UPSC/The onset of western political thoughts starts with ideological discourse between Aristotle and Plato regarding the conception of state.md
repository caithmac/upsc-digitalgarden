As Whitehead had remarked "The entire western political thought is just footnote to Plato and Aristotle. "
Plato gives the conception of ideal state and rule of [[Philosopher King|Philosopher King]].  He says â€œOur aim in founding the state was the greatest happiness of the whole, we thought that in a state which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find justice." This idea is well defended by scholars like Sabine, Barker and Sinclair who contended that philosopher ruled out of sense of duty to do good to others, and regarding the good of others. Even his critique [[UPSC/Karl Popper|Karl Popper]] agreed that, one can be either platonic or anti-platonic but can never be non platonic.
While, Aristotle gives the conception of pragmatic state. For him, state was the highest form of political union, for it represented pinnacle of social evolution. His idea has influenced [[UPSC/John Locke|John Locke]] in modern time and [[UPSC/Hannah Arendt|Hannah Arendt]] in Post Modern time.
By analysis of the following debate, we realize that all the western political ideology be it capitalism, socialism, communism or liberalism, all owe their beginning to original debate of role of state given by [[UPSC/Plato|Plato]] and [[UPSC/Aristotle|Aristotle]].
