Exploitation continue to advance from one mode of production to another mode of production, once exploitation reaches at maximum then consciousness will be generated, as per marx, revolution occurs to resolve contradiction.  If there is no contradiction there will be no revolution. 
- Revolution will occur when forces of production have completely matured and exploitation will be at peak. 
- As per Marx, the sequence and direction of social evolution can not be changed, thus revolution can not be advanced or postponed. 
- During revolution ploteriat class will capture means of production. There will be dictatorship of ploteriat in order to stop counter revolution and it will remain so until and unless communism will be established.

- Marx argued that these intermeditary class are actually divided but these division get surfaced only during struggle. He denied modern stratification approach and argued that classes have meaning only as they are real group in social structure. Here group means interaction among memebers common consciousness and similar type of behaviour in entire group member.

 ### Theory of Freedom by Marx 
 - A marxist view of freedom is fundamentaly different from captialist  or liberal freedom based on indivualistic freedom.
 - Marx criticsed captialist notion of freedom for disconencting or separating individuals freedom from society. Freedom is private acquistion of an isolated person. 
 - Liberal notion of freedom has nothing to do with inner aspect of human being. That is more connected with outer factor of wealth status and luxirious life. 
 - From marxist perpective freedom is essentially a associated with humanist philosophy. Freedom consist of not only the material satisfaction of human need but removing the conditions of de-humanization and alienation. 
 - Marxist believe that freedom has individualistic aspect, social aspect and it is also essentially associated with nature and forces of nature. 
 - Marxist freedom talks about moving out from freeedom of necisty. Marx explain that man can acquire scientific knowledge of natures law and make these laws work towards end of emanicaption of human society. 
 - Marxist revolution can only make people to take a leap from kingdom of nesceiety to kingdom of freedom. Human essence could be only realised only when the captialism will be routed out and communism is established.

##### Theory of Alineation 
- With discovery of youn Marx the traditional image of karl marx as an economist politician and socioligist, has now been eclipsed by the picture of him as humanist. In his book, "Economical and Philoshophical Manuscript", Marx presented humanist face of Marxism, he was more concerned about impact of Capitalism over human essence. He examined impact of capitalism in terms of alineation and loss of identity. 
- Marxist George Lukacs had devepoled Theory of Alination given by marx. 
- Marx identified three levels of alineation, fourth level is complete mechanization of human being. 
	- Human being is alinetad from his own product and work process, because worker plays no role in deciding what to produce and how to produce, it also destroy creativity of mankind. 
	- Only workers are not subject to alineation, but capitalist are too. 
	- Second Level - Man is alienated from his or her famliy and friends because of capatilaist value of competitivenes force everyone to live at an expanse of others and divide society into antagonistic class. 
	- Affection Love and closeness of family and social institution gets destroyed by spirit of competitivenes. 
	- Third Level - Man is alienated from nature. Because of lack of time, destruction of creativity, competitveness and struggle for existence, material satisfaction, alienate him or her from nature. 
	- Finally alienated man from his own work, family and nature gets alienated from himself and completely gets converted into machines. 
	- The realm of nescities dominates his life and reduce him to an animal existence. 
	- The capitalist system subordinates all human faculties and qualities to the condition created by private ownership of capital and property. 
- Frantz Fanon, TRIED To analyze radical consiousnes and identifed capitalism has completely destroyed normal human consciousnes and lead to radical consciousnes.. 
- Erichh Formm, he has been described as humanist marxist, neo-fredian He is big critic of modern civikisation and his understanding is known as psycho-political analysis modern capitalist system. In his boo ,'Escape from freedom', he treats modernisation as sole cause of political and social deformation of contemporary world. Security rather than freedom. Concept of indivulity , agressivenes, self assertion, pursuit of power and self worth replace conforism, coordination, conformation and suboridnation. In the modern era of capitalism which led to helplessnes and alineation.   
- Robert Nisbet - A leading socioligist was worried with problem of man from society. Alineation has been defined by him as " State of mind which can find hope and desire inviting apathy,boredom and even hostility. " He used the word profound dislocations of human being and accused rise of political state as root cause of alineation. 
- Herbert Marcuse - He identifed that modern capitalism replaced pleasure principle by performance principle based on efficiency. A society or civilization the individual can give expression to his creative and contemplative impulses and buildup higher form of culture based on harmony between man and nature is destroyed by  capitalistic desire for property, which he called surplus repression. In his book, "One Dimensional Man," he analysed capitalist impact in terms of reducing human personality. Capitalism erects materialistic needs and at the same time market provides solution. One dimensional man has been created through changes in consumption pattern and in the structure of labour force.

-  Marxist theory of economic determinism has been critisiced, it is not only the economic factor but other factors are equally important in bringing social change. 
- If economic determines society, polity and morality value system, then economy itself is shape by these, it is two way process. 
- Economic forces are not immune to the influences of polity, society,culture, religion, values, norms, if the base saves superstructure , then superstructure also saves base. 
- Fukuyama, rejected marxist theory but identified two major application of it, 
- It has been used as tool of social analysis 
- It gives voice to voiceless, voice of poor, oppressed people. 
- [[UPSC/Karl Popper\|Karl Popper]], 'Open Society and its enemy', criticized, [[UPSC/Plato\|Plato]], Hegel and [[UPSC/Karl Marx\|Karl Marx]]. According to Popper, Marx created the myth of class war and violent revolution. In Popper's view all these false prophet were advocate of close society that suppresses free speech, equal rights and critical deliberation. He further argued that science and freedom only flourished in open society and not  close society.
