Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central authority and constituent political units, such as states or provinces. In India, the Constitution establishes a federal system of government, with the central government and the states each having their own spheres of authority and jurisdiction. However, the distribution of powers between the central government and the states is not always clearly defined, and there have been instances where the central government has exercised more control over the states, leading some to argue that India functions more like a unitary state in practice.
In India, federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central government and state governments. The Constitution of India divides powers between the central government and the state governments, with certain powers reserved for the central government and certain powers reserved for the state governments. However, in practice, the functioning of federalism in India can sometimes give the appearance of a unitary state, due to the central government's ability to exercise significant control over the state governments.

One factor that can contribute to the central government appearing to exercise more control over the states is the presence of emergency powers, which allow the central government to take over the administration of a state in times of crisis. The central government has declared a state of emergency several times in India's history, and these periods have been marked by an increase in the central government's control over the states.

Additionally, the central government has the power to promulgate certain types of legislation that are applicable to the entire country, such as the Union List and the Concurrent List. This can lead to the central government having a greater influence over the states in certain areas of policy.

Overall, while India is a federal system of government, there are certain features that can make it appear more unitary in practice. However, it is important to note that the federal structure of the government is an important aspect of India's political system and is meant to balance the powers of the central government with those of the states.


In the Constitution of India, federalism is primarily established and regulated by Part XI, which consists of Articles 245 to 263. These articles outline the distribution of legislative powers between the central government and the state governments, and specify the subjects over which each level of government has jurisdiction.

Part XI also includes the Seventh Schedule, which lists the subjects that fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the central government (called the "Union List"), the subjects that fall under the concurrent jurisdiction of both the central government and the state governments (called the "Concurrent List"), and the subjects that fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the state governments (called the "State List"). The Union List includes subjects such as defense, foreign affairs, and communications, while the State List includes subjects such as public order, police, and local government. The Concurrent List includes subjects such as education, public health, and social security, over which both the central government and the state governments have the power to legislate.

In addition to Part XI and the Seventh Schedule, federalism in India is also regulated by other provisions of the Constitution, such as Article 355, which directs the central government to protect the states against external aggression and internal disturbance, and Article 356, which allows the central government to assume control over the administration of a state in certain circumstances.

Are there any quotes from scholars about it

There are many quotes from scholars about the functioning of federalism in India and the ways in which it may appear more unitary in practice. Here are a few examples:

1.  "The Constitution of India has created a federal system of government with a strong centre, and in practice, it has often functioned as a quasi-federal system or even as a unitary system, depending on the political circumstances of the time." - Sudhir Krishnaswamy, Professor of Law at National Law School of India University
    
2.  "The federal structure of the Indian Constitution has often been described as 'quasi-federal,' with the centre holding a preponderance of power and the states being relegated to a largely secondary role. The centre has used its emergency powers on several occasions to take over the administration of states, and the central government's power to legislate on a wide range of subjects has allowed it to exert a significant influence over state policy." - Pratap Bhanu Mehta, Indian political commentator and academic
    
3.  "India's federal structure is often described as a 'co-operative federalism,' in which the central and state governments work together to address common problems and challenges. However, in practice, the central government has often exercised a greater degree of control over the states, leading some to argue that India functions more like a unitary state." - Sujit Choudhry, Professor of Law and Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley
    

These are just a few examples of the many quotes that have been written about the functioning of federalism in India. It is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been the subject of much discussion and debate among scholars and political analysts.


Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central government and regional governments. In India, this system is established and regulated by the Constitution of India, which divides powers between the central government and the state governments. According to Article 245 of the Constitution, "the Parliament may, by law, extend, with such restrictions and conditions as it thinks fit, the laws made by it to any part of the territory of India not included in a State." This means that the central government has the power to legislate for the entire country, subject to certain restrictions and conditions.

However, the Constitution also gives the state governments significant powers and jurisdiction over certain matters. As stated in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the state governments have exclusive jurisdiction over subjects such as public order, police, and local government, which are listed in the "State List." The central government and the state governments both have the power to legislate on subjects such as education, public health, and social security, which are listed in the "Concurrent List."

In practice, the functioning of federalism in India can sometimes give the appearance of a unitary state, due to the central government's ability to exercise significant control over the state governments. For example, the central government has the power to declare a state of emergency and assume control over the administration of a state. As Article 356 of the Constitution states, "If the President, on receipt of report from the Governor of the State or otherwise, is satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution, the President may by Proclamation... assume to himself all or any of the functions of the government of the State."

This provision has been used several times in India's history, including during the 1975-1977 state of emergency declared by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, which gave the central government significant control over the administration of the states. The central government also has the power to appoint and dismiss state government officials, and to issue directives to the state governments on matters of national importance.

Despite these centralizing powers, federalism remains an important aspect of the government of India. It allows for the diversity of the country to be recognized and respected, and gives the state governments a significant role in the policy decisions that affect their constituents. As former Chief Justice of India P.N. Bhagwati stated, "Federalism is a basic feature of the Constitution and it is essential for the unity and integrity of the country."
