The role of the United States of America (USA) in the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism has been a subject of much debate and criticism in the field of international relations.

The United States of America (USA) has a significant role in the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism, accounting for 16% of world trade and being involved in over 40 disputes since the establishment of the WTO in 1995.

Scholars such as Robert Howse and Joost Pauwelyn argue that the USA has used its power and influence to advance its own economic interests, especially at the expense of developing countries. This bias was evident in the 2002 dispute between the USA and Brazil over cotton subsidies, where the USA was accused of blocking a ruling on its own cotton subsidies, undermining the impartiality of the dispute settlement mechanism.

Recently, the USA has blocked the appointment of new judges to the WTO's Appellate Body, raising concerns about its impartiality and independence. Scholars such as Richard Baldwin argue that the real reason for this block is to protect the USA's interests, leading to delays in resolving trade disputes and putting a strain on the dispute settlement mechanism.

The role of the USA in the dispute settlement mechanism raises questions about the credibility and stability of the global trading system. If criticisms continue and the USA continues to block appointments, it could negatively impact the system. The implications of the USA's role warrant further examination and analysis by scholars and experts in the field of international relations.
