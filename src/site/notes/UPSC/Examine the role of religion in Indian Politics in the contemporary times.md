Religion has played a significant role in Indian politics since the country gained independence from British rule in 1947. Many political parties in India have sought to appeal to voters based on their religious beliefs, and religious identity has often been a factor in the electoral success of candidates. **The role of religion in Indian politics has become even more pronounced in recent years, as religious tensions and conflicts have increased**." - Richard Bonney,

One example of the role of religion in Indian politics is the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is a Hindu nationalist party. The party has made appeals to Hindu voters and has sought to promote Hindu cultural and religious values in its policies. In 2019, the BJP won a landslide victory in the national elections, with many analysts attributing the party's success in part to its appeal to Hindu voters.

Another example is the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), a political party that represents the interests of Muslims in India. The party has sought to protect the rights of Muslims and promote the interests of the Muslim community in India.

**religious issues have come to the forefront of political debates**." - Sumit Ganguly

Scholars have noted the role that religion plays in Indian politics. For example, political scientist Ashutosh Varshney has written that "religion has been a central factor in Indian politics since the inception of the Republic," and that religious identity "has been a central determinant of political behavior and voting patterns in India."

In conclusion, religion continues to be a significant factor in Indian politics in contemporary times, with political parties seeking to appeal to voters based on their religious beliefs and identities. This can be seen in the electoral success of parties like the BJP and AIMIM, as well as in the ways in which these parties promote their respective religious values and interests.
