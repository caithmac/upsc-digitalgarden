#### Introduction 

>_“It is impossible to think about the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved. It is impossible for a bird to fly on only one wing.” —_ **Swami Vivekananda.**

> “The wife inspires or retards the husband;the mother makes or mars the child." - Annie Besant

>“The wife inspires or retards the husband;the mother makes or mars the child. The power of women to uplift...or debase man is practically unlimited and man and woman must walk forward hand-in-hand to the raising of India,elses he will never be raised at all...out of our schools and colleges shall grow the India of the future...the battle for the education of girls is just beginning and may Ishwara bless those who are vanguard and all beneficent powers enlighten their minds and strengthen their hearts...,” read extracts from her speech, ‘The EducationofIndianGirls’


- Status of women has changed over the span of recorded history. 
- From participating in Nationalist Movements to being pushed into the domestic household space, to their resurgence as super-women today, women in our country have seen it all. 
- Women rights have raise under the law, but in practice they continue to suffer from discrimination, harassment and humiliation. 

#### Condition of Women.  
##### Currently
- Woman do not have easy access to the formal sectors of employment. 
- Also there is no equal wage structure for both men and women. 
- Woman's power of decision-making is quite often circumscribed by familial, societal or community rules and norms.
- Women either as girl children or as pregnant women, or merely as women, do not get the require attention. This gets reflected in the rate of mortality and exposure to illness. 
- In cultural arena too, from religious discourse to the portrayal in media, women quite often are reduced to the role of what is called as second sex or quite often treated merely as an object or a commodity. 
- 
##### Early Vedic period 
- Complete freedom in every sphere and where places as central to creation of all the lives in the cosmos. 
##### Later Vedic period
- Considered as inferior and subordinate to men with denied political rights. 
##### Medieval Period
- Female infanticide, no education to girls, child marriage. 
- Bhakti movement - the status of women improved significantly across India. 
- Shankaracharya, Ramanuja, Guru Nanak - voiced against ill treatment and suppression of women.

#### Development and Gender. 
- ###### Why were the large women's movement not anti-developmental. 
	- If development was supposed to change the economic bases on which gender relationship was defined then it was presumed that the development was the preferred mode changing those base. 
	- Development was not merely economic progress but was closely related to the political expression of independence. 
	- Democracy and democratic institutions as constitution framers of India thought, were greatest guarantee of women's rights and well-being. 
	- First reform was Hindu Succession Act, 1956 
		- Women were given equal right of inheritance 

#### Agencies of Development 
- There is close link between the change of the overall status of women and the autonomy that she gains through changes in some crucial areas of her life. Like access to: 
	- Education 
	- Health care 
	- Employment 
	- Opportunity to take decisions.
- Society doesn't grant these without struggle. 
- The agencies which help her in her growth and development are : 
	- Individual(herself)
	- The community that she lives in. 
	- State. 
- Key to development of women is to provide them with the cover of justice because only in such a situation can these capabilities be ensured. 

#### Critique of development
- In India, women are double exploited 
	1. They are woman. 
	2. They are poor.
-  Class and gender both fuse in them. 
- Issues not limited to : 
	- Domestic Violence 
	- Sexual choices 
- But basic human development items: 
	- Education 
	- Health 
	- Employment
- Need to come out of the vicious circle of poverty which prevented them from even coming out of the tyranny of tradition. 
- Women were included in more often than not confined to the reproductive role which was a stereotypical western understanding of the Third World women.
- [[United Nation\|United Nation]] since 1975 - Year of Woman - has brought issues related to women in the major international forum. 
- Women's development flourished during freedom struggle. 
- Constitution even accepted equal rights to vote, it vindicated that struggle of 1947 had accepted the basic ethos of equality. 
- Some [[feminist\|feminist]] authors have shown that [[India's Green Revolution\|India's Green Revolution]] as a classic example of how development was anti-women. 

#### Empowerment 
- Only possible when they participated in their own development and this in turn was possible only when the concentration were to be small with an effective local level development vision 
> [[UPSC/Amartya Sen\|Amartya Sen]], "freedom in one are foster freedom in other area as well"

- During 1980 - gender was made an important component in development programming. 
- Beginning of the 30% reservation for women in panchayats for women to enter decision making domain. 
- Issue of 30% for them in parliament and state legislature then was taken up but is still mired up in controversies and debates. 
- Only 9% of women in the upper house 
- 11% in lower house. 
- Women can be given freedom only through development.  By providing
	- Literacy 
	- Health 
	So as to give her wherewithal to change her economic standing the family and society and thereby improve her position in order to wrest decision making powers too. 
	- The indicators like education, health, or life expectancy does not simply reflect the well being of the woman involved, but as commented by many economists or sociologists, its fruits are shared by the coming generations too.
- World Bank, -Female Labor Force Participation Rates (FLFPR) 
	- 120/131

##### Why low labour force participation 
- Increased income of men - 
- Caste factor - Stigma attached to women working outside the home. 
- Safety issues and harassment at the workplace -Women more vulnerable to exploitation and harassment at work in developing countries. 
- Double Burden - Family and Work Place
-  [[UPSC/Maternity Aspect\|Maternity Aspect]] :
- [[UPSC/Education-Employment Trade off\|Education-Employment Trade off]]

###### Suggestion to improve FLFP 
- Introduction of digital and STEM education in schools. 
- Using tax policies to incentivize women into the labour market
- Promoting large scale social campaigns for changing social norms which break gender stereotype, which includes women as well as redefining the role of men in households support services. 


##### Gender Gap and Gender Inequality 
- Due to unequal treatment, society's gender norms, the economic status and financial literacy among the women shows downward trend. 
- Major factor curbing potential candidates from performing where they ought to. 
- ###### Global Gender Gap report 2020
	- Published by the [[World Economic Forum\|World Economic Forum]] 
	- 112/153 
	- **Reason behind Gender Pay Gap**
		- Preference for male
		- Break in woman due to parenthood duties and other socio-cultural factors. 
		- Lack of flexible work policies or extended leave. 
		- Lack of involvement of women in male dominated sectors. 
		- Glass ceiling effect

##### Maternal Health: 
- Poor maternal health often affects a child's health in adverse ways and also decreases a woman's ability to participate in economic activities. 
- National Rural Health Mission and Family Welfare Programme have been created to address the maternal health care needs of women across India. 
- ###### Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan 
	- Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
	- Provides antenatal care free of cost
	- Guarantees a minimum package of antenatal care services to women.

	- ###### Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana 
		- National Food Security Act,2013
	- ###### POSHAN Abhiyan 
	- 



#### Marital Rape
- Act of sexual intercourse with one's spouse without the consent of the other spouse. 
- Martial rape is not a ground for a divorce in Hindu Marriage Act,1955, Muslim Personal Law(Shariat) Application Act,1937 and Special Marriage Act 1954.
- Section 375 of the IPC holds that “sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape”
##### Criminalization of Martial Rape is necessary
- "Status of Women in India". - Pam Rajput committee of Ministry of Woman and Child Development, criticized the legislature for its failure to criminalize martial rape. 
- Exception under Section 375 - violates Article 14,15,19 and 21 of a woman. 
- Patriarchal nature of Indian society, ingrains it in the minds of men that women are expected to comply when their husbands demand sex. 
- Victim suffers physical abuse, and she also has to undergo mental trauma of her dignity being violated. 


#### Summary 
- Historically given a lower socio-economic and political status in society.
- Continues in modern societies. 
- Democracy and development are two main areas by which the state has to progress in order to modernize the state, society and institution in order to guarantee equal and legal rights to both men and women.
