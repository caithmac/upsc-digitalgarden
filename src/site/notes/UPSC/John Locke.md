## Two Treatise on Civil Government.
- First Treaty critiqued Robert Filmer's "Divine Theory of King" written in book Patriarcha 
- Filmer supported political and religious doctrine of royal and political legitimacy
	- As it says King or Monarch is not subject to any earthly authority because it derives its power the will of god. 
	- King can not be judged or ordered either by people or aristocracy but only by God. 
	- People don't have any right to protest or resist and only god can judge an unjust king. 
	- Protest against kings is protest against god and it creates a disrespectful act. 
- Filmer rejected idea of social contract and argued that man is not born outside or before a state or society. This social contract is illogical even if people enter into contract but next generation is not part of it.
- Lock argues that there is no evidence that the God has given any authority to any King or authority. 
- Even if we agree God did that, then there is a conclusive prove that God has allowed Adam to pass the authority to his son or successor. 
- There is a problem in identifying who are the real successor. 
- Locke finally says so much time has passed since supposedly God gave authority to Adam, that the event itself has lost relevance and we need a new contract to establish new rules of authority 
- Locke in his **second treaty of civil Government** explained that "Man being by nature is all free, equal and independent, no one can be put out of this state, and subjected to political power of an other, without his own consent." He further explained state of nature. Human nature is good helpful, people live in harmony and help each other. Optimistic view of human nature. Human being is self centered but also has reason. *Human being is worried about his own interest but at the same time he takes care of other as well.* State of nature is condition is state of peace, goodwill, mutual assistance and preservation. Locke identified 3 natural right, life, liberty and natural right. He identified laws of nature as inner morality that determine behavior of people. Reason is the core of law of nature. *Men are rational and everyone treats other as they would treat themselves.*
- As per Locke state of nature proved to be inconvenient. Locke identified two major inconvenience.
	- Common authority to interpret law, at the same time implement those law. There was always threat that everyone can become judge of its own case that is violation of natural justice.
