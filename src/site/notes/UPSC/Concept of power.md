	- It has two aspects- 
		- extractive or ethical
			- Man should use his capacity in a way so that he may extract benefits from other. It leads to power of extractive power. 
		- development, or empirical dimension respectively. 
			- Since a mans ability to use and develop his capacity becomes the power, it is called mans development power.
	
- ##### Marxian Theory 
	- Links politics and economics through instrument of power. 
	- [[UPSC/Karl Marx|Karl Marx]] viewed political power as being possessed those who control means of production. The relation of production therefore determines distribution of political power. 
	- Thus, [[UPSC/Karl Marx|Karl Marx]] sees a close integration between political power and prevailing socio-economic system and regards it as transient - it shall disappear with rise of stateless and classless society. 

### Dimension of Power 
- Power has two specific dimension 
	- Transitive
		- Consist of subordination of ones will by will of another.
		-  In this sense power is not possible without counter power, both in symmetrical relationship. 
		- Max Webber'̥s formulation reflects transitive power. 
	- Intransitive 
		- It is not zero sum game but has positive pay off. 
		- It refers to the subordination one persons will to the will of another, within a community. It takes into account, the communality that exist within members of community.

##### Legitimacy Crisis
>[!error] Introduction 


- Habbermass has developed an alternative to webberian approach to legitamacy. 
- Habbermass didn't adopt orthodox marxist position which saw legitimacy as nothing more than burgoise myth. 
- Habbermass admited that modern capitalist society or liberal democracy have a system of drying out of consent and support of the people. Democratic system, party system, social and welfare reforms are mechanism to maintain consent and legitamacy. 
- In his work "Legitamacy Crisis 1973", he identified arising crisis tendency within capitalist society. These crisis tendency emerged as a result of fundamnetal contradiction between the logic of capitalist accumulation and popular pressure of welfarism unleashed by democratic politics. 
- In modern capitalist society legitamacy is secured by democratic process, which lead to further demarcts for social welfare provision. Increased poupular participationn and social equality. 
- This inturn puts pressure on the state to expands its social responsibility and state intervention for removing inequality. Such demands and activities leads to increased expenditure on welfare. 
- It leads to increase in taxation and public spending and restrict capitalist accumulatiuon by restricting profit level and discouraging interpricess. 
-  Thus a capitalist society is constantly in the grip of crisis tendency that is legitamacy. 
- According to habbermass capitalist democracy can not satisfy both for popular demands for social equality welfare right and requirement of a market economy based on private proft. The implication of such crisis involves a disturbance  of integration or cohesion of society and regulatory structure of capitalist system

>[!hint] Conclusion

###### State Action 
- In such scenario of crisis, modern state uses resources for system steering and ideologiocal measure to legitamise and stablise the existing structure. 
- State not only try to dissociate political and economic sphere but at the same time promote non intervrntion in economy is the best way of development. (Margret Thatcher's Roll back of state)
- With above measure state gets success in establishing that the exploitative relationship between wage labour and capitalist is no longer part of political spehre. Politioal sphere becomes less personal and highly beuracrised.
