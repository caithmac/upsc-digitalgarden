- Arguments of :
- Working class has not evolve into revolutionary movemnt
- Economic class interest are autonomous to ideology and politics. 
- The objective of socialism transcend class interest. 
- Socialist movement may evolve independent of classs. 
- The struglle from socialism comprises of plurality resistance to inequality and oppression. 
- A political force may form out of popular political and ideological elements, independent of class ties so that feminist and ecological peace and other forces become effective in changing society.

#### State 
- Hand medium of ruling class. 
- Neo Marxist reconceptualise concept of state in post industrialist societyy. 
- Pearson identified specific feature of neomarxistststae
	- The state doesn't either instrumentaly or relatively autonomosuly function in the interest of single class. 
	- The state is not a centralised unified political actor it is an arena of struggle constituted and divided by quite and opposing interest, 
	- there can't be satisfactory analysis of capitalist state. 
	- The proper subject of study in a given nation state is there historical and international particularity. 
	- The state can not be overcome and will not wither away it is essential to any developed society. 
	- The state is not an instrument that can be occupied, the state power is not such that it can be seized. Transformation of state maybe profound, but it willl also be gradual and internal. 
- In Neomarxism the state was analysisd by two thinkers, Ralph Miliband and Nicos Poulantzas.
- Nicos : Capitalist bourgoises state exist in structural sense. In othe words, state and its organisation function internally and its relationship to society where shaped by class relations of capitalist society. 
- Ralph : The modern state seems to democratic but power and politics were dominated by capitalist class through variety of mechanism. Modern states seems to be neutral because of electorate, political parties and interest group but in reality power and politics were dominated by capitalist class directly or indirectly. 
- Capitalist class exert its power and domination through different mechanism. 
- Instrument of fair electorate, political parties, interestgroup were meerly projection and these above mentioned instituion were completely controled by [[Capitalist\|Capitalist]] class.  
 ###### Conclusion
- It is not the only capitalist class, but capitalist state limits relatively autonomus state ruled by maybe neutral government.
