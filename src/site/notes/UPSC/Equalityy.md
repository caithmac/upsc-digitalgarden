		- Dworkin is critical of welfare egglatarian and adequate his theory of Equality of resources, 
		- When inequality emerge due to uniequal tallent there is no redistributoon to equalise but he believed that justice requires an equal auction from time to time and equality of resiurces is devoted to whole life because we must not allow distrubtion of resources to be endownment sensetive that is being affected by difference principle. 
	- ##### Equality of capability 
		- Amartya Sen criticised existing models of understanding of equality. He also criticised measures taken to adress problem of equality. He was convinced of the inadequacy of income inequality, economic and resources equality and even the combination of all three
		- **Income and economic equality contradict with non-economic circumstances and this inturn, results in inequality.**

		- For example; a person may have required primary goods and resources but his incapability may come in way of achieving what other person can attain with same set of goods.
		- What is important for Sen is what a person is actually able to do, not just what he posses. 
		-  Being healthy, being educated, being educated, having political and civil rights are basic functioning without which one can not achieve anything. He differentiated between attainment equality and shortfall equality. 
		- Attainment equality refers to freedom to achieve equal functioning. 
		- And short fall equality refers to freedom to achieve according to ones given capability. 
		- For Sen capability reflects freedom to choose between alternative lives and its value need not be derieved from one particular comprehensive doctrine. Demanding one specific way of life. 
		- Samuel 
		- He took equality debate beyond comodity space. He builds the notion of freedom into the concept of equality. As per Sen what is central to the capabilty conception of equality is individual ability to function converting the resource into actual freedom and to achieve the ends and objective one has se t in life. 
		-   Martha Nussbaum worked in a similar line in her book, "women and human developent: capability approach discussed life and conditions of women in India "
		- Susan Moller Okin : Aims at providing all that which is necessary for complete human life. Therefore her claim, "her approach is respectful for each person for flourishing, that treats each person as an end and as a source of agency and worth in her own right. " 
		- Samuel Scheffler : Rejects the commonly known conceputalisation of value of equality as distributive idea and defines it as "a moral idea governing the relation in which people stand one another"
