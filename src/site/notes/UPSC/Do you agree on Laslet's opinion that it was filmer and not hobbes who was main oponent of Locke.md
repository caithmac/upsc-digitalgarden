 Robert Filmer argues that kings are choosen by gods and man is not free and is able to choose a ruler.  All government is absolute monarchy and no man is born free, this led to [[UPSC/Thomas Hobbes\|Thomas Hobbes]] and Filmer being compared together since Hobbes believes that " Fear and I were born twins together." The nature of absoultist state is also common ground between the two. 
Differences between Hobbes and Filmer, Hobbes never says that absolute monarchy is the only system just prefers it over democracy since the division of sovereign powers makes decision making difficult. Filmers argument to support monarchy is entirely different. Monarchy is given by God, whereas [[UPSC/Democracy\|democracy]] is created by people.
Filmer believes that people can't govern themselves therfore monarchy is needed. 
Atleast in Hobbseian State of Nature individual is born free. For Filmer no one is born free. 
For Hobbes peole can choose who can rule them, Filmer gives no such choice. 
Locke's position is really different from both Filmer and Hobbes, L:ocke rejeects the idea of absolute monarchy so his primary objection is wth Filmer since he believes human is born free, individuals are rational and thus capable to govern themselves. 
Lockean state is not absolute and can be replaced. And most importantly his individual like all otheer has an equal claim on power of state, Locke rejects the Divine theory of Kings. 
Locke's divergence from Hobbes
- State of Nature of Locke is not as dark as Hobbes. 
- Lockean contract doesnt demand all right. 
- Lockean state further divides the authority into legislative and executive. Therefore negating the possiblity of absulitist rule even further. 

- Basically bothe Hobbes and Locke will be against Filmer's argument but beyond this Hobbes and Locke also diverge since their viewpoints are based on entierly conception of human nature. 
- Hobbesian pessimism creates a surviavle based state, whereas Lockes optimism creates more liberal.
