##### What to read and why? 


 What are BA.4 and BA.5, BA.2.12.1, and BA.2.38 — the new variants of coronavirus in circulation currently?

 The biggest difference between the current surge and the one in January is that there is no cluster formation with any of the emerging sub-variants. And in a country the size of India, a few cases of a variant is of major concern — especially when there are no changes in symptoms or hospitalisations.

Genome sequences uploaded to the global database GISAID show that BA.2.38 — which branched off from BA.2 — is dominant in the country, accounting for 30% of all sequences over the last 30 days.
