The Eurocentric construct of the modern state has been heavily criticized by scholars in the field of international relations, particularly in relation to its ability to serve the needs of Third World countries in the process of nation-building. This is because this construct, which is based on Western liberal democratic principles, is often imposed upon non-Western countries without regard for their unique cultural and historical contexts.

One example of this is the recent takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban. Despite over a decade of international efforts to establish a stable, democratic government in the country, the Taliban was able to gain control once again in a relatively short period of time. 

This can be attributed to a number of factors, but one of the most significant is the fact that the Western-backed government was not able to gain the support of the Afghan population, in large part due to its failure to take into account the country's unique cultural and historical context.

The concept of "cultural imperialism" is often used to describe this phenomenon, where dominant Western powers impose their own values and norms upon non-Western societies. 

This can be seen in the way in which the West has attempted to impose liberal democratic principles upon Afghanistan, despite the fact that these principles may not be well-suited to the country's cultural and historical context.

Another important factor to consider is the concept of "dependency theory", which argues that Third World countries are often dependent upon developed countries for resources and economic support, leading to a lack of autonomy and self-determination. This is certainly true in the case of Afghanistan, which has long been dependent upon foreign aid and support in order to maintain its government and economy.

In conclusion, the Eurocentric construct of the modern state is not well-suited to the needs of Third World countries in the process of nation-building. This is especially true in the case of Afghanistan, where the Western-backed government was not able to gain the support of the population due to its failure to take into account the country's unique cultural and historical context. In order to truly be successful in the process of nation-building in Third World countries, it is important for the international community to take into account these cultural and historical contexts, and to move away from Eurocentric models of government and development.
