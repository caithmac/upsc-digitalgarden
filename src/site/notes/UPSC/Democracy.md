# Democracy
- Democracy is considered best practicable form of government in narrow sense it is form of government based on people's participation in broad sense it is value system and way of life.

> Democracy is just top soil of India. India has political democracy but no socio economic equality. One man one vote is not sufficient there has to be one man one value.
 
Democracy first arrived in west European countries and was called 'First Wave' as per [[Huntington|Huntington]]. 
- The reversal of first wave happens with rise of totalitarian ideology, [[UPSC/Fascism|Fascism]], [[Nazism|Nazism]] and Stanlism.
