	- Decline of Greek state

- So he tried to define knowledge and make it mandatory for ruler class. 

### Explain 
- Meaning of Reality is shadow of idea.
### Application
- Making decision 
- Choosing the ruler
- Power, glory, and wealth should not be target of ruler. 
- Through this philosophy he started to find rulers who hold real knowledge. 
---Till 150 word--- 
- Ideal is real is a one way philosophy 
- It was well contested by the materialist. 
- Matter is equally important. 
--- 

>[!todo]+ Idea is reality - Comment
>In Plato's mind Idea is the reality. For him it is the ultimate truth. He explained that what we sense or know through sensory organ is just reflection of ideas or true reality, it is not real. His argument presented the thought that Ideas are essence of everything which remain constant, permanent and never gets destroyed. Thus it is true reality.  
>He presented this philosophy for the purpose of searching of true knowledge, which was based on Socrates theory of knowledge.  The context of it can be linked to two major events that took place in his lifetime. First, he had to face death of his teacher Socrates. Second, the decline of the Greek state. He blamed both of these events on incompetence of ruler class. So he tried to define knowledge and make it mandatory for ruler class. 
>He explains the philosophy by [[UPSC/Allegory of the Cave|Allegory of the Cave]]. In this story, people mistakenly understand shadow as reality. It is similar to phenomena which happens in real life. This understanding that physical world is temporary and reals of ideas is permanent is crucial for ruling class. Rulers must understand that power, wealth, glory are temporary. Virtue and integrity are permanent.

Topic:: Evolution of Plato's Education System
Date:: 2022-06-24
Course:: [[UPSC/PSIR|PSIR]] 

----
##### Evolution of Plato's Education System
- Equality of opportunity -> Men and Women get to harness their capability 
- Education System is of all round development 
- Theoretical as well as practical 

###### Criticism 
- Stresses more on administration and rulers
- More opportunity available to two classes
- Aims to produce ideal philosopher not man of action 
- More emphasis on Maths/Philosophy not on literature 
- Timer period of 35 years- Expensive and Hazardous
- After passing through such long process it will be difficult for the guardians to maintain efficiency as desired by Plato 
- as outcome of education all men/women do not posses equal  capacity for virtue therefore all are not entitle to participate in function of government on  basis of equality.

Topic:: Karl Popper
Date:: 2022-06-27
Course:: [[UPSC/PSIR|PSIR]] 

----

# Context 
- Open Society and its enemy
- Identifies [[UPSC/Plato|Plato]] as a totalitarian 
- For providing One class to rule. 
 
## Body 
##### Karl Popper 
###### Enemy of open society 
- He accuses Plato of monopolizing military virtues and training for the ruling class and excluding the producer class from any political participation. 
- As per Popper justice for Plato is principle of class rule and class privileges. The state is just only if the rulers rule, workers work, slaves serves/.
- Even concept of Communism of Property and Wives denies basics of life like family and wealth to a large chunk of population. 
- For Popper Plato's political programmed is far from being morally superior to totalitarianism, is fundamentally identical with it. 
- Division of society is hard and fixed
- There is nothing beyond these two classes. 
- Role of every person is fixed for life. 
- No option of switch or change
- All Political powers belongs to [[UPSC/Philosopher King|Philosopher King]] - no one can say anything against him. 
- Orders are final and [[UPSC/Philosopher King|Philosopher King]] is not limited by his own orders. 
- No circulation; no space of evolution -> means -> closed society where nothing new will be allowed 
- There is monopoly of merit/quality
- Is a class rule not rule of law. 

###### Totalitarian 
- Above law
- Control over all aspect of life. 
- No one is above ruler. 
- All rights belong to him. 
- Monopoly of trades.
- Principal of class rule and class privileges.
- [[UPSC/Philosopher King|Philosopher King]] is holding final knowledge 
- His ordinance are not mightier than knowledge 
- He is above all laws; even laws made by him or her. 
- [[UPSC/Philosopher King|Philosopher King]] restrict everyone to remain in their domain and release order to follow it. 
- Against democracy. 
- 


## Criticism 
- Commentary with Popper and against him. 
- Bertrand Russell calls Plato a totalitarian.
- Levinson in support of Plato 

## Defense of Plato against Popper's critique
- Plato's state is not police state. Rather it is lead by rational and ethical ruler who had a life of education. training, dedication and renunciation.
- Since order in society can  destroy individual himself, Plato is concerned about order and society and rulers with well ordered souls. 
- The [[UPSC/Philosopher King|Philosopher King]] are denied even basic amenities like family and property. Plato's rule can be anything but not rule of privilege class. 
- Platonic state enabled the individual to fulfil himself to highest capability. Therefore, state was not end in itself but means. 

## Conclusion 
While Popper's critique of Plato is not without merit the philosophical defense for Plato's state also is valid. Platonic theory therefor has been rightly appraised by Whitehead's comment; "The entire western political thought is nothing but footnote to Plato and Aristotle." also summarized by Popper as, "One can be Platonic or anti-Platonic but never non-platonic."

Topic:: Plato's Feminism
Date:: 2022-06-24
Course:: [[UPSC/PSIR|PSIR]] 

----
# Plato's Feminism
#### Argument: 

##### First feminist 
- Men and Women were allowed to be in any class. 
- Made mandotry for women's consent. 
- In his [[UPSC/Theory of Education|Theory of Education]] all kids are allowed to take state sponsored education. 
- Greek was stratified; women condition was poor, he didn't make any special reference to women; hence treating them same as everybody. 

##### Not feminist; accidental feminist. 
- He failed to mention women. 
- Generally meant men. 
- Accidently left women. 
-  ***I thank God that I was born Greek and not barbarian, freeman and not slave, man and not woman; but above all, that I was born in the age of Socrates***
- Hard to believe that he made such big mistake; Women condition was bad. (Opposition of above argument)
