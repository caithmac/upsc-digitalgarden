While he believes that the [[UPSC/State is prior than individual|State is prior than individual]] this is in terms of relative importance and not in chronological sense. 
Aristotle's organic conception of state proves its necessity not only for protection, continuation of its live and its potential.
It is the state and participation in politics which makes us human since for Aristotle man is social and political animal.

State is self suficing instution whereas village and family is not, therefor it preceds them in importance. 
Aristotle's emphasis on worth of state is centered on worth of individual but it is limited only to best practicable state and doesnt promote any abstractt conception which will threaten the life or good life of individual.
