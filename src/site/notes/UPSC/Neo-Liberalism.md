##### Phases of Neo-Liberal Discourses

   - This phase witnessed interventions like structural adjustment policy. - cut in food subsidies, social spending, development of corporate welfare, capital market deregulation and cut in unnecessary expenditures from public budget. 
   > This phase also witnessed rise of social and protest movement. 
   
2. Washington Consensus(1980s)

##### Neo- Liberalism State
- State should be minimal state and must be limited to function of providing security against force theft fraud at the same time enforcement of contract.  
- State must be there to promote the interest of everyone mainly in economic terms. 
- Neo-Liberals support workfare state against welfare state. 
>As per neo-liberals idea behind workfarism is poverty , unemployment doesn't occur because there are few jobs but because unemployed people are ill suited to jobs or who do not have economic ideas vibrant. 
>Libertarian state has to provide all such activities which leads to consolidation of individual rights establishing free markets and establish peace. 


>[!error] Concept of [[UPSC/Robert Nozick\|Robert Nozick]] is considered to be best explanation of neo-liberal state
> 1. All individual have inalienable rights independent to society. They are not dependent over the state or society for possessing of the individual rights. 
> 2. Function of state is to ensure there should not be violation of this inalienable right of individual. Nozcik believe in "Nightwatchman state"
> 3. Liberty must get priority over equality. Function of state must be limited only to ensuring exercise of liberty.  
> 4. He categorically instructed state not to go for [[Progressive Tax\|Progressive Tax]] , Public Healthcare. State intervention means both ones resources and ones self. Seizing the result of some ones labor is equivalent to seizing hours from him and directing various activities thus welfare state is threat to liberty and independence of individual. 
> 5. [[The minimal state is inspiring as well as right\|The minimal state is inspiring as well as right]]. What is important is that state must not use coercive apparatus for purpose of getting some citizens other and prohibit activity of other for their own good and protection. 


>[!error] Hayek's View 
>
> 1. His view support neo-liberalism
> 2. Liberty or freedom of a person is non coercion and he must not be subject of arbitrary will of another person. 
> 3. Liberty must not be confused with any other meaning of freedom.
> 4. Absence or presence of a freedom can not be sufficient condition of liberty. Liberty is bigger condition which enable a person to act as per his will without being under arbitrary will of either state or individual. 
> 5. State might emerge as a threat to liberty in this way freedom from constraints of state is condition of liberty. 
> 6. In order to promote liberty state should be confined to minimal work and to promote free competition and must not take cohesive measure. 
> 7. Hayek further argued that equality is essentially absence of constraints and equality of opportunity. Thus restricting once liberty will minimize equality of opportunity.  
> 8. He further argued that there is substantial difference between people's talent and skill. Any effort to bring equality other than equality of opportunity will bring inequality. 
> 9. Any attempt to bring equality other than equality of opportunity can not be done without force and will lead to limitation on liberty. States attempt to bring equality other than equality of opportunity is coercive in nature and will deprive person of liberty and freedom. 
> 10. Social Justice is a mirage.
