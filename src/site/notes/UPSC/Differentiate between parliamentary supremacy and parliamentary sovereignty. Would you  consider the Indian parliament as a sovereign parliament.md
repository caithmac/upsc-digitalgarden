>[!error] Introduction 

Parliamentary supremacy and Parliamentary Sovereignty are two closely related concept in political system of some countries, particularly those with a parliamentary system of government. Both terms refers to idea that parliament is the supreme legal authority. Though they have few subtle differences. 

>[!done] Body 

Parliamentary supremacy is the idea that country's parliament is supreme law making body. It has the power to make laws on any subject. It focuses on the parliament's power to make or unmake law it chooses. But this comes with a caveat. It can be limited by various factors 
1. Written Constitution : This establishes clear limits on the powers of parliament. It also provides for mechanism for challenging overturning of laws that are deemed to be unconstitutional. 
2. Federalism : By decentralizing of power, Parliament power will be limited by giving other institution, such as regional and local government , a greater say. 
3. Judicial Review : Parliament power are subject to judicial review and they have the power to declare laws unconstitutional if they violate fundamental principles and rules laid down by constitution. 
4. Fundamental Rights: 

Parliamentary Sovereignty on other hand is the idea that parliament is the highest and ultimate legal authority. It has power to pass any law it deems fit, without being subject to the authority of any other body or institution. Parliament has power to make or unmake law. 
This idea is not dependent on the presence or absence of written constitution. 
For eg, if UK were to adopt a written constitution, Parliament would still be the supreme law making body and its decision would still be legally binding and can not be challenged by any other institution. 

Indian parliament can be considered sovereign. As highest legislative body in India it has the power to make laws and exercise control over the country's government and policy-making. 
The presence of written constitution and judicial review does not necessarily negate its sovereignty. They do have limit the power of parliament, and keep checks and balance on the power of government and other branches of government. But it is also true that a soverign parliament is the one which has the ultimate authority to make laws and exercise control over government, even if its power are constrained.
