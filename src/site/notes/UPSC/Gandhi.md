# Introduction

- Gandhi wrote extensively in **Indian Opinion**, **Young India** and **Harijan**, the leading newspapers of the era, where he commented on the issues of contemporary relevance
- His political strategies 
	- They were organized around local issues
	- In mobilizing people for the movements, the role of local leaders was most critical.

>[!quote ] With his involvement in mass movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad, Gandhi ‘forged a new language of protests for India by both building on older forms of resistance, while at the same time accepting the colonial censure of all forms of violent protest’ (Hardiman 2003: 51).

- Gandhi led three major pan-Indian movements. The 1919–21 
	- [[UPSC/Non Cooperation Movement\|Non Cooperation Movement]] was the first one that gained significantly with the merger of the Khilafat agitation of the Muslims against the dismantling of the Khalif in Turkey. 
	- The Civil Disobedience Movement was an all-India movement in which Gandhi reigned supreme. Basically a salt satyagraha, the Civil Disobedience campaign had manifested differently in different parts of India. 
	- The 1942 Quit India Movement, also known as the open rebellion, was the last of the three pan-Indian campaigns that Gandhi spearheaded
- Features of these mass mobilization 
	- Gandhi remained the undisputed leader who appeared to have swayed masses with his charisma and ‘magical power’
	- Despite their pan-Indian characteristics, these movements were independently organized by the participants drawing on local grievances both against the rural vested interests and the government for supporting them
- His political ideology was a radical departure from the past in the sense that it was neither constitutional loyalism of the Moderates nor extremism of the revolutionary terrorists
- Gandhian thought is neither purely political nor absolutely social, but a complex mix of the two, which accords conceptual peculiarities to what the Mahatma stood for.

## Basic Percepts of Gandhi 
### Ahimsa
>[!quote] ...ahimsa meant ‘both passive and active love, refraining from causing harm and destruction to living beings as well as positively promoting their well-being’ (Parekh 1999: 130).1
- Gandhi did not mean merely ‘non-injury’ to others that was a mere negative or passive connotation; instead, ahimsa had also a positive or active meaning of love and charity. 
- Had two contrasting definiton 
	- Narrow 
		- Simply meant avoidance of acts harming others;
	- Positive 
		- it denoted promoting their well-being, based on ‘infinite love’
- *Ahimsa* was complementary to Gandhi’s model of conflict resolution that was certainly the most original and creative model of social change and political action even under most adverse circumstances
- ahimsa was critical to the entire exercise of satyagraha,
- Not only did it articulate the nature of the campaign, it would also structure the form of resistance by guiding those involved in it.
- ‘the science of non-violence’
### Satyagrah
- Satyagraha meant resistance. Not merely passive resistance, but ‘intense activity by the people.’
- Denoted ... political action by the people against brutal state power
	- Legitimate 
	- Moral 
	- Truthful 
- It was a movement against various forms of injustice meted out by the state. 
- The Rowlatt satyagraha translated the Gandhian ideas into action, 
- Watershed in Gandhi's political ideas. 
	- Gandhi now realised the potential of the growing mass discontent in the anti-British struggle
	- This satyagrah was also a litmus test for Mahatma who now was confident of satygraha as a technique for political mobilisation 
- Satyagraha was not, therefore, identical to passive resistance.
- Gandhi was of the opinion that passive resistance ‘fails to convey what he meant.
- the similarity between satyagraha and passive resistance was just peripheral since both of them were clearly defi ned methods of political resistance which were opposed to violence
- Satyagraha was not ‘physical force’ but ‘soul-force’ that drew on the spontaneous sacrifi ce of self by the participants,

## Gandhi's Swaraj
- Swaraj was defined as 
	- National independence
	- Political freedom of the individual
	- Economic freedom of the individual
	- Spiritual freedom of the individual or self rule
- Complementary to each other

##### National independence
- Gandhi preferred the term swaraj to its English translation, presumably because of the difficulty in getting the exact synonym in another language
- it broadly meant human emancipation as well
- swaraj was most creatively devised by the Mahatma who never restricted its meaning to mere political freedom from alien rule
>[!quote] ‘mere withdrawal of the English is not independence. It means the consciousness in the average villager that he is the maker of his own destiny, that he is his own legislator through his own representatives

##### Political Freedom 
- For Moderates : Political freedom meant autonomy within the control of British administration. They wanted this freedom by constitutional means.
- For Extremist : Didn't care much about methods. Complete independence, which meant full withdrawl of the British from India.  
- For Gandhi,  Freedom from various kinds of atrocities, justified in the name of primordial social values was as important as freedom from colonialism.

##### Economic Freedom 
-  For Gandhi : The future lay in Charkha and Khadi. 
  >[!quote] ‘If India’s villages are to live and prosper, the charkha must become universal.
- He was convinced that industrialization as it manifested in the West was simply devastating for India
  >[!quote] no amount of socialisation can eradicate ... the evils, inherent in industrialism
- His support for traditional crafts was not based on conservative reasoning, but on solid economic grounds in the sense that by way of critiquing the Western civilization, he had articulated an alternative model of economic development that was suited to the Indian reality.

##### Spiritual Freedom or Self Rule
- self rule as an important ingredient clearly indicates the importance of moral values which are relative to society

#### Gandhi's Idea of Swaraj 
- Is based on the philosophical notion of advaita, which is 
- ‘etymologically the kingdom or order or dispensation of “sva”, self, myself or the truth that you and I are not other than one another’
- rooted in Indian metaphysics and spirituality
-  Swaraj in Gandhian conceptualization invariably translates into, argues Fred Dallmayr (2000: 111), ‘the self rule of a larger community, that is, into a synonym for national democratic self government or home rule.’

## GANDHI’S CRITIQUE OF MODERN CIVILISATION
- Gandhi was a visionary who could foresee ills of  industrialization and modernization. 
- His Hind Swaraj depicts his understanding of the chaos in modern civilization. 
- Having witnessed the human devastation that industrialization had caused in England, he warned us of the impending dangers of an urban industrial society.
  >[!quote] ‘God forbid that India should ever take to industrialism after the manner of the West. The economic imperialism of a single tiny Kingdom (England) is today keeping the world in chains. If an entire nation of 300 millions (India’s population in 1928) took to similar economic exploitation, it would strip the world like locusts’
- England and USA had divided world into races and places for purpose of exploitation. 
- He questioned what would be the of India trying to ape the west? 
- Gandhi firmly believed that India lives in its villages. And to erode its village’s culture and civilization via technology, machinery, and industrialization, to him, amounts to sin
- He warned the youth not to be carried away by the glitter of modern civilization because ‘its defects are well known but not one of them is irremediable’.
- He advocated village life as the goal, as India is an inheritor of rural civilization.
- He was also against the use of machinery that is meant to displace people for their livelihood means. 
- Modern civilization with its explicit or implicit stress on unabated exploitation of resources, multiplication of wants, production and consumption is satanic. 
- Gandhi argued, ‘instead of welcoming machinery as a boon, we should look upon it as an evil, it would ultimately go’
- He concluded that modernity is civilization which takes note neither of morality nor of religion. Immorality is often taught in the name of morality. Civilization seeks to increase bodily comforts, and it fails miserably even in doing so' 

## Conclusion 
- A seriously argued case against modernity that was believed to have unleashed processes embodying progress, reason and liberation.
- Gandhi also carved a space for alternative practices, which were distinctly local or relevant to specific c contexts that could never be ignored without costly consequences.
