Socrates was political guru of Plato and he attempts to make Socrates immortal by  transforming his ideas into a proper and complete philosophy.
Death of Socrates resulted in deep disdain of democracy which eventually prepares the background of emergence of ideal state. 
The mixture of incompetency and oratory resulted in a weak and corrupt state which needed to be replaced with the rule of wisest and best individual. His words show extensive use of dialectical method reflecting the style of dialogue between Socrates and pupil.
Socratic influence is also evident in all scholars who argued for ideal state and thinkers who used dialectical method like [[UPSC/Karl Marx\|Karl Marx]] and Hegel.
The rule of capable individual irrespective of popular support is manifested in idealism as well as fascism. The disdain for democracy on the other hand gets reflected through leftist tradition of western thoughts.
