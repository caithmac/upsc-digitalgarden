##### What to read and why? 



India has imported about 3.5 lakh tonnes (lt) of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser from Russia,

The imports have been contracted by Indian Potash Ltd, Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers, Chambal Fertilisers and Krishak Bharati Cooperative at landed prices of $920-925 per tonne, cost plus freight (CFR). This is below the rates paid by other countries for DAP, mainly from China, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Jordan.



mporting from Russia has presented problems from sanctions, forcing “innovative methods” of making payments. “The risk in this case has had to be borne by the seller (PhosAgro), since banks weren’t willing to open letters of credit (to serve as a guarantee for payment) on the importers’ behalf. Payments were then made by telegraphic transfer to the seller’s account, upon the latter physically presenting the necessary documents (copy of invoice, certificate of origin, bill of lading, insurance policy, etc) 7-10 days after the cargo had set sail,” the sources explained. The total voyage time from Russia’s Baltic Sea ports is 25-30 day

“The imports have come at the right time when sowings for the kharif season have just started and will peak in July,” the sources added.
