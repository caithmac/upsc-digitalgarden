- Essentially lies in power of determining on behalf of community what needs to be done to promote peace and order to promote welfare. 
- All men apart from sovereign becomes its subject.
- Sovereignty is its absoluteness. Ultimate source of law. Sole interpreter. Divine laws are not applicable over sovereign although he accepted existence but sovereign is the sole interpreter. 
- Sovereignty is indivisible, inseparable and can not be communicated or given anybody else. Sovereign is also creator of property and taxation doesn't require consent of people.

###### Purpose of State
- Most important thing for which state is exist preservation of life.
- If a state is not able to do so, it is failed state. 
- And man has every right to resist the state. 

##### Materialism 
- Hobbes proposes to analyze human kind from materialistic point of view with same symbolic language. 
- Hobbes proposes to study human being as a set of purely physical process.  That are reducible to body and motion. 
	- Two Types of Physical Motion
		1. Vital - Those basic and unthinking life function. This purely comprises purely physical aspect of human existence. 
		2. Voluntary - Those forms of human activity that are willed such as walking and speaking. Hobbes include Politics and other social and other various kind of social functions here. That is mainly psychological in nature. Knowing and willing constitute the whole of our psychological process. 


##### Individualism 
- Man being prior to state. 
	- Opposite of [[UPSC/State is prior than individual|State is prior than individual]]
- Man is individualistic by nature and social only out of necessity. 
- [[UPSC/Hobbes was first individualist|Hobbes was first individualist]] 

##### Absolutist
- One who gives absolute power to the state. 

##### Human Nature 
> Life of a man is continuous search for power, after power which ceasesth only with his death. 

>[[UPSC/Hobbesian Theory of Right|Hobbesian Theory of Right]]
###### Reason behind power seeking nature of man. 
- Applies "[[resolutive compositive method|resolutive compositive method]]" to explain the fundamental characteristics of human nature. 
- Human Mind is made up of particle like everything else in Universe. They are in state of motion. 
- All motions can be categorized into basic types - Love and Aversion. 
- Love
	- Pleasure 
	- Emotion of Love 
- Aversion
	- Generates pain
- Hence there is a continuous desire for things which give pleasures. 
- Man is never satisfied. 
- Satisfaction of one pleasure give rise to search of the other.
- Power is a means to obtain the things which gives us pleasure. It can be physical power, economic power, political power or any other sort of power.



##### Liberty 
> Liberty is where law is silent
- Extreme liberty results into anarchy. 
> Liberty signifies properly the absence of opposition in external impediments to motion. 
- Hobbs has provided justification to the absolute authority of the state. 
- Preference of security over liberty. 
- Man has no liberty where state has made laws/ 
> Liberty in proper sense is absence of law.
