What is called Directive Principles is merely another name for the instrument of instructions. The only difference is that they are instructions to the legislature and the executive’

#### Criticism of DPSP

##### No Legal Force 🚓👮🏽
>[!Quote] 
>‘a cheque on a bank, payable only when the resources of the bank permit’

>[!Quote]
>no better than the new year’s resolutions, which are broken on the second of January
>~Nasiruddin

>[!Quote]
>a veritable dustbin of sentiments

>[!Quote]
>manifesto of aims and aspirations’

##### Illogically Arranged 😷
>[!Quote]
>‘the Directives are neither properly classified nor logically arranged. The declaration mixes up relatively unimportant issues with the most vital economic and social questions. It combines rather incongruously the modern with the old and provisions suggested by the reason and science with provisions based purely on sentiment and prejudice'
>~N.Srinivasan

 ##### Conservative 😒
>[!Quote]
>>"The ghosts of Sydney Webb and Beatrice Webb stalk through the pages of the text. Part IV of the Constitution expresses Fabian Socialism without the socialism"
>
>>"‘are deemed to be suitable in India in the middle of the twentieth century. The question whether they are suitable for the twenty-first century cannot be answered; but it is quite probable that they will be entirely out moded. "
>~Sir Ivor Jennings,
