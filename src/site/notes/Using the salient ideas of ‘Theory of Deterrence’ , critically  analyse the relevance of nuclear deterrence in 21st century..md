The theory of deterrence, first developed during the Cold War, posits that the possession of nuclear weapons deters other nations from attacking by threatening the potential use of nuclear weapons in retaliation. 
The theory of deterrence is based on the idea of mutually assured destruction (MAD), which argues that the use of nuclear weapons by one nation would result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.

In the 21st century, the relevance of nuclear deterrence has been subject to much debate among scholars and policy-makers. On one hand, some argue that nuclear deterrence is still relevant in the current international system, as it provides a powerful deterrent against aggression and maintains strategic stability
. The possession of nuclear weapons by certain nations, such as the United States, Russia, China and Pakistan, is seen as a way to prevent a nuclear war and maintain the balance of power.

On the other hand, critics argue that the theory of deterrence is becoming increasingly irrelevant in the 21st century. They argue that the possession of nuclear weapons does not necessarily prevent conflicts or aggression and may even increase the likelihood of nuclear war. The potential for accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons is also a concern, as well as the fact that the use of nuclear weapons would result in devastating humanitarian consequences.

Additionally, the increasing focus on non-traditional security threats such as climate change, economic inequality, and transnational terrorism, has led many to question the utility of nuclear weapons as a deterrent. Furthermore, the concept of deterrence relies on the ability of the state to control its own weapons, and the increasing risk of non-state actors acquiring nuclear weapons undermines the effectiveness of deterrence. This is particularly true in Pakistan, where there are concerns about the security of the country's nuclear weapons in light of the rise of non-state actors such as the Taliban and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The fear is that these non-state actors may acquire nuclear weapons and use them for terrorist attacks, which would have devastating consequences for the region and the world.

In conclusion, the relevance of nuclear deterrence in the 21st century is a complex and contested issue. While it is still seen by some as a powerful deterrent against aggression and a means of maintaining strategic stability, others argue that the growing focus on non-traditional security threats and the increasing risk of non-state actors acquiring nuclear weapons call for reevaluating the utility of nuclear deterrence in the current international system. The possession of nuclear weapons by certain nations and the concept of deterrence has prevented the outbreak of nuclear war, but the increasing risk of non-state actors acquiring nuclear weapons and the growing focus on
