It has two aspects- extractive and development, which can be called ethical and empiracal dimension respectively. Since a mans ability to use and develop his capicity becomes the power, it is called mans development power. Beside man should use his capicity in a way so that he may extract benefits from other. It leads to power of extractive power.
