# Sovereign 
- Denotes that India is no more a colony. 
- Right to self determination bot in external and internal sphere. 
- Freedom tomake policies. 

## Why a question on it? 
- Because of globalisation. 
- It weakens the sovereignity of state in theory. 
- However, in case of India it can not be said that it has weakned the sovreignity. 
- Ability to exercise powere depends on the power and there is a phenomenal increase in the power of India. 
- It is recognised as 
	- Intellectual power
	- Economic power, 
	- Neuclear power.
	- Strongest contender for permanent seat in UNSC
- However it would not be correct to say that there has been no dullution at all. 
- Infact gloabalisation expects to exercise their sovereignity in a more reposnsible manner. 
- Acting in  tandem with eachother.
