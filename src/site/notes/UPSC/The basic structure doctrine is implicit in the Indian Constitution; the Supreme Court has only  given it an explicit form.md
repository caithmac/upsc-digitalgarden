[[UPSC/Supreme Court\|Supreme Court]] has not provided an exhaustive list of feature that constitute the basic structure of the constitution. 

After  [[UPSC/Kesavananda Bharti Case\|Kesavananda Bharti Case]], court has given explicit form to the BSD in a number of subsequent cases.
As can be seen in the following timeline.

It has identified some of the key principle that are part of BSD, such as sovereignty of the constitution, rule of law, and separation of power. 
They are not explicitly mentioned in the constitution but are implicit in the underlying values of constitution.

In recent years court has applied BSD in number of cases, such as Durga Shakti Nagpal case and KS Puttaswamy case. It also declared  National Judicial Appointments Commission(NJAC) which was brought by parliament by 99th Amendment Act, unconstitutional and scrapped it. 
Recently Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar , came down heavily on SC for striking down the NJAC Bill.  He said that rarely in democracy we see such massive support to a constitutional legislation. Yet, it was undone by the Supreme court on basis that it was not in line with judicially evolved  doctrine of 'basic structure'  

 
>[!tip] Conclusion
>The precise contours of the basic structure doctrine are a matter of ongoing debate and judicial interpretation. It is an important principle of Indian constitutional law that holds that certain features of constitution are fundamental to it.
