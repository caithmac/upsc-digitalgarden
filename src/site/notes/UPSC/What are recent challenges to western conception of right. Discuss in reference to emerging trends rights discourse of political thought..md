>[!error] Introduction
>The idea of rights provides for an essential tool of analysis of the relations between individual and the state. If the state claims authority, individual must claim right. This claim was further pushed forward after WW-II, with "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" in 1948. 

>[!done] Body 

The idea of human rights encompases whole range of rights of human beings. The idea of such thing emerged because of Nazis commiting barbaorus and inhuman atrocity, and not only war crimes but crimes against humanity. 

The general concept of human right is based on very noble and rational principles. They stand for those rights of human beings which aim at the protection of human dignity and elimination of inhumane treatment to any person under any circumstance.  No reasonable person will quarrel with this laudable idea of human rights. 

Though there are various challenges to the universal character of human righst. They mostly come from advocates of  "cultural relativism" who argue that human rights for any particular community should be based on its cultural values and practices and not any universal principle. 

Critics also argue that these rights tend to create and sustain the institution of liberal democracy and market model of economy which are not conductive to the values cherished by some societies, particularly some developing nations.

Supporter of [[UPSC/Debates of Asian Value\|Debates of Asian Value]]  criticised human right regime as it aims to promote individualism, a competitive social order and consumerism.  It was biased towards western philosophy and society. 


>[!tip] Conclusion 
> In contemporary world, the debate on rights has resulted into many new resolution being added over the decades, in various forums and convenstion for better coverage of world. 
> But it also has increased wrong tendencies, which save hardened criminal in name of Human Rights, and see certain culture as backward just because they differ. These should be analysed with utmost caution.
