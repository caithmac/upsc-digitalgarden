>[!error ] Introduction
>Interstate water disputes refer to conflicts between two or more states in India over the use, distribution, and management of water resources. Water is a critical resource in India, and disputes over its use and management are common due to the country's diverse and often competing water needs.

Interstate water disputes in India are typically resolved through negotiation and mediation, with the central government playing a role in facilitating the resolution of these disputes. In cases where disputes cannot be resolved through negotiation, they can be referred to the Inter State water dispute tribunal set up by article 262 for resolution.

Some examples of interstate water disputes in India include the Cauvery water dispute between the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the Krishna water dispute between the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra, and the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal dispute between the states of Punjab and Haryana.

Overall, interstate water disputes are a common and complex issue in India, reflecting the country's diverse and often competing water needs and the importance of water as a critical resource.

### What are constitutional mandates for it

The Constitution of India provides for the resolution of interstate water disputes through a number of provisions. Here are a few examples of constitutional mandates related to interstate water disputes in India:

1.  Article 262: This article provides for the establishment of an Inter-State Water Disputes Tribunal to resolve disputes between states regarding the use, distribution, and control of inter-state rivers and river valleys. The Inter-State Water Disputes Act, 1956 outlines the procedures for the establishment and functioning of these tribunals.
    
2.  Article 263: This article establishes the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, as a forum for the settlement of inter-state disputes. The council can refer disputes to an arbitrator or mediator for resolution, or it can refer disputes to the Supreme Court for a final decision.
    
3.  Article 131: This article gives the Supreme Court the power to hear and determine disputes between states, or between states and the central government, as well as disputes involving inter-state rivers or river valleys.
    

Overall, the Constitution of India provides for a number of mechanisms for the resolution of interstate water disputes, including the establishment of Inter-State Water Disputes Tribunals, the role of the Council of Ministers as a forum for dispute resolution, and the power of the Supreme Court to hear and determine disputes involving inter-state rivers or river valleys.



### Supreme Court can not hear the water disputes

I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The Supreme Court of India does not have the jurisdiction to hear and determine interstate water disputes directly. Instead, the Constitution of India provides for the establishment of an Inter-State Water Disputes Tribunal to resolve disputes between states regarding the use, distribution, and control of inter-state rivers and river valleys.

Under Article 262 of the Constitution, the central government can refer an interstate water dispute to the Inter-State Water Disputes Tribunal for resolution. The Inter-State Water Disputes Act, 1956 outlines the procedures for the establishment and functioning of these tribunals.

In cases where an interstate water dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation or mediation, the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, can refer the dispute to an arbitrator or mediator for resolution. If the dispute is not resolved through arbitration or mediation, the Council of Ministers can refer the dispute to the Supreme Court for a final decision.

Overall, while the Supreme Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear and determine interstate water disputes directly, it can play a role in the resolution of these disputes through arbitration or as a final court of appeal.

### What are examples of cases and their outcome and any committee or commission related to it

There have been several cases of interstate water disputes in India that have been resolved through the Inter-State Water Disputes Tribunal or other mechanisms. Here are a few examples of cases and their outcomes:

1.  Cauvery water dispute: The Cauvery water dispute is a long-standing dispute between the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka over the use of the Cauvery river and its tributaries. The dispute was referred to the Inter-State Water Disputes Tribunal in 1990, and the tribunal issued its final award in 2007, allocating water to both states and establishing a dispute resolution mechanism for future disputes. The award was accepted by both states, and the dispute has largely been resolved.
    
2.  Krishna water dispute: The Krishna water dispute is a dispute between the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra over the use of the Krishna river and its tributaries. The dispute was referred to the Inter-State Water Disputes Tribunal in 1969, and the tribunal issued its final award in 1973, allocating water to all three states and establishing a dispute resolution mechanism for future disputes. The award was accepted by all three states, and the dispute has largely been resolved.
    
3.  Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal dispute: The Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal dispute is a dispute between the states of Punjab and Haryana over the construction of a canal to link the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers. The dispute was referred to the Supreme Court of India for resolution, and the court issued its final decision in 2018, directing the central government to construct the canal as per the original plan.
    

In addition to the Inter-State Water Disputes Tribunal, there have also been several committees and commissions that have been established to address interstate water disputes in India. For example, the Bhakra Beas Management Board was established in 1966 to manage the distribution of water from the Bhakra and Beas dams to the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. The Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 between India and Pakistan, established the Indus Water Commission to resolve disputes over the use of the Indus river and its tributaries.

Overall, there have been several cases of interstate water disputes in India that have been resolved through the Inter-State Water Disputes Tribunal or other mechanisms, and there have been several committees and commissions established to address these disputes.
