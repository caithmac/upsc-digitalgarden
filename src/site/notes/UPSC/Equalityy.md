		- John Scharr : It asserts that each man should have equal rights and equal opportunity to develop its own talent and virtues and there should be equal reward for equal performance. 
		- It was criticised in general as presence of equality of opportunity doesnt mean use of opportunity. Therefore mere presence of opportunity will not result in accomplishment of social goal.

		- Llyod Thomas gave three model

	- ###### Equality of welfare 
		- Utilatarian and welfarist consider welfare as inherently good and argue that welfare needs to be equalised, the problem with this theory is that, there are different conception of welfarem, what is cosidered being wellbeing may not be considered so by other. 
		- The conception of welfare differs from society to society.

	- ###### Equality of resources 
		- Dworkin is critical of welfare egglatarian and adequate his theory of Equality of resources, 
		- When inequality emerge due to uniequal tallent there is no redistributoon to equalise but he believed that justice requires an equal auction from time to time and equality of resiurces is devoted to whole life because we must not allow distrubtion of resources to be endownment sensetive that is being affected by difference principle. 
	- ##### Equality of capability 
		- Amartya Sen criticised existing models of understanding of equality. He also criticised measures taken to adress problem of equality. He was convinced of the inadequacy of income inequality, economic and resources equality and even the combination of all three
		- **Income and economic equality contradict with non-economic circumstances and this inturn, results in inequality.**
		- He argued that because of parametric variation income resource are material goods do not go hand in hand. 
		- He identifeid 5 types of parametric variations 
			- Personal Hetroginity 
			- Environmental diversity 
			- Variation in social climate 
			- Difference in relational perspective 
			- Distribution within family
		- Mr Sen argued that economic equality, resource equality are important but all these are important but are not sufficient condition equality of functioning. 
		- For example; a person may have required primary goods and resources but his incapability may come in way of achieving what other person can attain with same set of goods.
		- What is important for Sen is what a person is actually able to do, not just what he posses. 
		-  Being healthy, being educated, being educated, having political and civil rights are basic functioning without which one can not achieve anything. He differentiated between attainment equality and shortfall equality. 
		- Attainment equality refers to freedom to achieve equal functioning. 
		- And short fall equality refers to freedom to achieve according to ones given capability. 
		- For Sen capability reflects freedom to choose between alternative lives and its value need not be derieved from one particular comprehensive doctrine. Demanding one specific way of life. 
		- Samuel 
		- He took equality debate beyond comodity space. He builds the notion of freedom into the concept of equality. As per Sen what is central to the capabilty conception of equality is individual ability to function converting the resource into actual freedom and to achieve the ends and objective one has se t in life. 
		-   Martha Nussbaum worked in a similar line in her book, "women and human developent: capability approach discussed life and conditions of women in India "
		- Susan Moller Okin : Aims at providing all that which is necessary for complete human life. Therefore her claim, "her approach is respectful for each person for flourishing, that treats each person as an end and as a source of agency and worth in her own right. " 
		- Samuel Scheffler : Rejects the commonly known conceputalisation of value of equality as distributive idea and defines it as "a moral idea governing the relation in which people stand one another"
		- He further conceptualise it as 
			- Equality is moral value 
			- Is social idea
			- Is political idea
		- There is undeniable differences among people in terms of trait, abilities and circumstances. 
		- There can not ever be equality in empirical terms. This could be only in format of ideals. 
		- He further argued that normative ideal of equality should be the basis of society of equal. 
			- Not in emperical sense. 
		- For him, the basic question of political philosophy what it is for people to relate as equals, what so of - social, political and economic institution, are appropriate to such society. 

 ##### Priority view of Derek Parfit 
 - He accept equality in format of value of redistribution and he proposed how redistribution should work categorising it in line of priority. 
 - He eastablishes his view of game of person effective claim. 
	 - Position A : A and B are equal. 
	 - Position 2 : A has worked hard and has risen above B 
	 - Position 3 : By leveling down A is again brought down to level of B. 
 - He further argued in different game that there should be priority of compensation, he identified three category to be compensated. 
	 - Category 1: Those who are worse off in life as a whole. 
	 - Category 2: Those who are worse off at the time. 
	 - Category 3: Those who have need that are moraly urgent. 
#####  Harry Frankfurt Doctrine of Sufficency
- He created new debate by introducing radical moral view that, eggelaterian concern should be sufficiency not equality. In his article, equality as moral idea, he as criticized economic egalataranism on basis of hollow effect. 
- He makes a claim that his doctrine of sufficiency provides an alternative to egalataranism. 
- Economic equality is imposible because people conceptualis equality as per their individual nature and circumstances. He further argues that equality is imposible task as it can not be achieved through material possesion,. For him what is important from point of view of morality is not that everyone should have same but that each should have enough. And enough is essentialy associated with the basic need.
