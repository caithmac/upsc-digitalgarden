I. Introduction

-  Introduce the topic of the socialist perspective of the Indian national movement
	- The socialist perspective of the Indian national movement was a major ideological force in the struggle for independence from British colonial rule. It was a movement that sought to bring about a more equitable society, one that would be based on principles of social justice and economic equality. It was a movement that sought to challenge the existing social and economic structures of the colonial period, and to create a new, more equitable society. The socialist perspective of the Indian national movement was based on the belief that the existing system of exploitation and oppression of the Indian people had to be replaced by a system of social and economic justice. It was a movement that sought to bring about a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources, and to ensure that the rights of all citizens were respected and protected. It also sought to bring about a more equitable system of taxation, and to ensure that the government was accountable to the people.
-   Provide some background information about the national movement in India and the development of socialist thought
	- The national movement in India was a long-term struggle for independence from British colonial rule. It began in the late 19th century and continued until India achieved independence in 1947. During this period, the Indian National Congress (INC) emerged as the leading political organization in the struggle for independence. The INC was founded in 1885 by a group of Indian nationalists, including lawyer and scholar A.O. Hume, lawyer and statesman Dadabhai Naoroji, and lawyer and activist Surendranath Banerjee. The INC was initially a moderate organization, advocating for constitutional reforms and greater autonomy within the British Empire. However, as the struggle for independence intensified, the INC began to adopt more radical positions, including calls for complete independence. During this period, socialist thought began to gain traction in India, with the formation of the Communist Party of India in 1925. The Communist Party advocated for the overthrow of the British colonial government and the establishment of a socialist state. This idea was further developed by Jawaharlal Nehru, who became the first Prime Minister of India after independence. Nehru was a strong advocate of socialism and his government implemented a number of socialist policies, such as the nationalization of key industries and the introduction of land reform
