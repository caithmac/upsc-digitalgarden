 Represntative government for Mill is the best form of government since it most adequatly fulfil purpose of government. 
 The functions are 
 - Using the existing potential of individual to further his interest and further increasing the potential itself. All other formats of government may fulfil the first function but only RG fulfils both. 
 - It is only the RG which combines the principle of participation and competence to fulfil the function of protecting and educating the citizens. 
 - Mill says every individual is the best judge of his interest and negating the idea that some are not competent or capable to know the same. He says that based on a person's current desposition whatever he chooses is his real interest. 
 - He argues that participation in political process should be as extensive as possible including even women. He does creates an exception that those who are not literate or didn't pay taxes or lived on government relief should not be allowed to vote. 
 - Mill points that in presnt majority based system, minority goes unrepresnted therefore he argues for propotional representation. 
 ###### Mill's reluctancy v/s defence of reprenstetive government. 
 - While he wants to widen the franchise he also introduces the factor of competence via plural voting. 
 - For Mill, the representative assembly should be a committe of grievances and congrees of opinion, every groups interest should be given a voice. Which shows direct manifestation of the argument he gave in defence of liberty. 
 - But Mill doesn't want such assembly to be interested with either legilation or administration. 
 - Legislation would be done by Codification commission and administration to be done by beuracracy. 
 - Competennce or Capability for Mill is of two types
	 - Insturmental Capability - is about identifying methods to fulfil certain means. 
	 - Moral Competancy - To recognise the general and superior interest of individuals and society and to resist the sinter interest. Which usually present themselves in democratic majority. To avoit such sinister interest he advocates proportional representation. 
- Mill was criticised as reluctant democrat for introducing specific institutional changes. Like delayed introduction off democracy in colony, plural voting, and open ballot. But it is clear that these limitation on RG are only to ensure that participation is matched by principle of competence so that whole political experience has developmental and educational effect.
