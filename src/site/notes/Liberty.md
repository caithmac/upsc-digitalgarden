Topic:: Positive Liberty
Date:: 2022-08-09
Course:: [[UPSC/PSIR|PSIR]] 

----
##### Positive Liberty
- State can extend liberty of person. 
- State can add value judgements to liberty. 
- State intervention. 
- The idea of liberty is not in vacum
- Not without objective or porpuse, 
- Values are essentially attached with it,
- Thus positive liberty talks about regulated and intervened liberty for greater pourpose and extension of liberty. 
- Positive liberty supports interventation of state in order to promote an effextive exercise of liberty. 
- The core concept emphasised that positive liberty is the liberty of all in a civil society. 

- Quentin Skinner : He is credited with bringing back the positive notion of liberty in discussion of liberty.
- In his famous essay, "A third form of liberty", he argued that the concept like liberty are deeply normative, highly inderminate and extensively implicated in a long history of ideological debate and therefore the only way is to understand them in historical context. 
- Christman argued that positive liberty is essential in inequal society where range of limitation are there and few of them are self imposed. "Saving positive freedom"
- "Few of them are self imposed" : 
- Taylor and Pitt argued in favour of positive liberty asking for state intervention not only to realise liberty. But at the same time to realise it in a meaningful way. 


##### Criticism 
- Alex Zakaras : Criticised [[UPSC/I Berlin|I Berlin]] for not looking into 'freedom as acess to an adeequate range of alternatives.' 
- Skinner : argued it well that liberty and free state can go together. In free state liberty is possible.
