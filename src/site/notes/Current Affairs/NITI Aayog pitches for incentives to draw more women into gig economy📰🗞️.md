##### What to read and why? 

In an attempt to increase participation of women in the gig economy, the [[NITI Aayog |NITI Aayog ]]has proposed fiscal incentives like tax breaks or startup grants for companies with about one-third of their workforce as women and people with disabilities (PwDs).

>“Fiscal incentives such as tax-breaks or startup grants may be provided for businesses that provide livelihood opportunities where women constitute a substantial portion (say, 30%) of their workers. Likewise, a platform with high accessibility or high degree of participation of PwDs too may be rewarded with fiscal incentives

> NITI Aayog said in a report titled ‘India’s Booming Gig and Platform Economy’.

>The report also said that female labour force participation in India has remained low, oscillating between 16 per cent to 23 per cent in the last few years.
>
>Structural barriers like access to education and lack of skilling have hindered participation of the two demographic groups in the country’s labour force,

>To encourage more women, platforms may develop better infrastructure and work design, enhance skill development, asset ownership, access to digital skills and technology, undertake gender sensitization and accessibility awareness programs for workers and their families,
>

>Gig workers are typically hired by companies on a contractual basis and are not considered their employees. As a result, they do not receive some of the benefits that an on roll employee of the company may have — this means that they often do not receive benefits like paid sick and casual leaves, travel and housing allowances, and provident fund savings, among other things.
