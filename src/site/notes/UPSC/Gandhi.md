# Introduction

- Gandhi wrote extensively in **Indian Opinion**, **Young India** and **Harijan**, the leading newspapers of the era, where he commented on the issues of contemporary relevance
- His political strategies 
	- They were organised around local issues
	- In mobilising people for the movements, the role of local leaders was most critical.

>[!quote ] With his involvement in mass movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad, Gandhi ‘forged a new language of protests for India by both building on older forms of resistance, while at the same time accepting the colonial censure of all forms of violent protest’ (Hardiman 2003: 51).

- Gandhi led three major pan-Indian movements. The 1919–21 
	- [[UPSC/Non Cooperation Movement|Non Cooperation Movement]] was the first one that gained signifi cantly with the merger of the Khilafat agitation of the Muslims against the dismantling of the Khalif in Turkey. 
	- The Civil Disobedience Movement was an all-India movement in which Gandhi reigned supreme. Basically a salt satyagraha, the Civil Disobedience campaign had manifested differently in different parts of India. 
	- The 1942 Quit India Movement, also known as the open rebellion, was the last of the three pan-Indian campaigns that Gandhi spearheaded
- Features of these mass mobilisation 
	- Gandhi remained the undisputed leader who appeared to have swayed masses with his charisma and ‘magical power’
	- Despite their pan-Indian characteristics, these movements were independently organised by the participants drawing on local grievances both against the rural vested interests and the government for supporting them
- His political ideology was a radical departure from the past in the sense that it was neither constitutional loyalism of the Moderates nor extremism of the revolutionary terrorists
- Gandhian thought is neither purely political nor absolutely social, but a complex mix of the two, which accords conceptual peculiarities to what the Mahatma stood for.
