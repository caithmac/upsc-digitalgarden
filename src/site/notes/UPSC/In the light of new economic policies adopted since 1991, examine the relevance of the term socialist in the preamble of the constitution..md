>[!error] Introduction
> In 1991, India adopted Neo-liberal policy based on Washington Consensus.
> Its adoption of LPG - liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation marked a tremendous shift from its socialist economic framework which was on work since India's independence implictly and explicitely as added by [[UPSC/(Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976\|(Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976]] 




>[!done] Body 
 
 The adoption of neo-liberal policy of free market approach was neseciated by the slow pace of economic growth and widespread of corruption and inefficienc. 
 This increased economic growth, and India has clocked for over a decade, a growth rate in GDP of 6% or more, barring Covid years. This was achieved by increased FDI and FII. 
 It also has led to increase in industrialisation and bussiness growth. Which in turn has created job opportunities for worker. 

But all this has also led to widening disparity. Oxfam report has stated that top 1% hold more than 4 times wealth than what 70% of India's hold. 
In absolute term, India has managed to bring people above poverty line. Yet relative poverty has increased over the past few decades. 
Many argue that principle of socialism, such as the provision of basic good and services and the promotion of equality, remain relevant and should be upheld. 
They also argue that social and economic rights provided by consititution, such as right to work, right to education and right to decent standard of living are not being protected and relaised in true sense. 


>[!tip] Conclusion
> While liberalisation has had positive effect, it also had led to increased inequality and job loss in certain sectors. 
> It may be necessary to find a balance socialist and liberal policies and to implement them so as to deal with poverty, socio economic inequality and access to basic ammenities while promoting economic growth and development.
