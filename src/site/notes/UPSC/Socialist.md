## Why a question on it? 
- Since 1991, there has been widening disparity. 
- 1% Indian hold 70% of wealth. 
- There has been growth in malnutrition and hunger. 
- The absolute number of people living below poverty line has decreased but the relative poverty has increased. 
- Many argue that principles of socialism, such as the provision of basic goods and services and the promotion of equality, remain relevant and should be upheld.
- Put to a question since India has adopted Neo-liberal mode of development based on Washington Consensus. 
- As in 1991, adoption of LPG - liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation  marked a significant shift away from the socialist economic framework that had been in place since India's independence. 
- However, the slow pace of economic growth and widespread corruption and inefficiency led the Indian government to adopt a more market oriented approach.
- There has been positive effect such as FDI,FII and faster economic growth.
- Though the above situation are matter of concern, we cannot say that completely ignored ideals of socialism. 
- We have accepted concept of inclusive growth. 
- 11th and 12th FYP addresed the unemployment and poverty. 
- Schemes like PM-Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) 
- Government has been focusing to bring majority of people in social security net with minimumm leaks. 
- For a country as large as India with as big population, socialism will always remain for betterment of masses.
