### Femenist Conception of Justice

	- Her theory identified women as subject of justice. 
	- In her opinion gender as social construct is the root cause of unfairness and injustice. There is requirment of restructuring and reconceiving roles and opportunities for women. 
	- She further argues that without changing patriarchal structure, justice can not be acheived. Source of injustice is not only in public domain but also in private domain. 
	- Understanding everyone as individual is delibrate attempt to ignore gender difference. Therefore justice must range from private(family,society) to public. women to citizen. 
	- She argued that there is a posibility of creating universal framework of justice. Applicable in all society as gender is a factor of injustice across the globe. 

#### Rawl's Theory of Justice
- [[Distributive Justice|Distributive Justice]]
- Liberal tradition 
- [[Egalitarian|Egalitarian]] 
- Kantian assumption 
- He was mainly *worried* about outcome of Liberal theroem of Justice
- He completely rejected the methodology of Marxist and [[UPSC/Socialist|Socialist]] justice. 
- He was willing to fuse procedural and substantive justice. 
- Method of distribution should be procedural and result should be substantive. 
- *Original Position*
- *Veil of Ignorance* 
- Justice as fairness is Rawl's theory of justice for liberal society. Rawl's constructed justice as fairness around specific interpretation of the ideas that citizens are free and equal and society should be fare. He sees it as a resolving tension between ideas of freedom and equality, which have been highlighted both by socialist critique of liberal democracy and by conservative critique of modern welfare subject. 
- Justice as fairness aimes to describe a just arrangement of the major political and social institution of the liberal society,. The political constitution, legal system and economy and family and so on. 
- Rawl calls this arangement as basic structure. 
- Basic structure is the location of justice because these institution distribute main burden and benefit of social life. 
- Rawls in order to establish his theorem of justice imagined a condition that is original position. 
- ##### Original Position
	- Aims to move from abstract conception to determinate principals of social justice. 
	- The stratagy of OP is to construct a method of reasoning that models idea of justice. 
	- OP is an imaginary situation,in which each real citien has a representative and all representative have come to agreement on which principal of justice should order political institution of real citizens. 
	- OP is a fair situation in which each citizen is representated as only free and equal citizen. 
	- Each representative wants only what free and equal citizen wants. And each tries to agree to the prinicpal for basic structure while situated fairly wrt other representative. 
	- The most striking feature of OP is *vigil of ignorance*, which prevents arbitary facts from citizens from influencing agreement among their citizens. 
	- Each representative in OP is therefore deprived of knowledege of race, class and gender of citizens they represent. 
	- In fact the vigil of ignorance deprives party of all fact about citizen which are irrelevant to choice of principal of justice. 
	- Moreover the vigil of ignorance screens out specific info. what soceity is rn. So as to  get as clearer view of permanent features of just social system. 
	- In vigil of ignorance parties do not know 
		- Age 
		- Gender 
		- Ethinicity 
		- Race 
		- Income 
		- Wealth 
		- Natural Indominate 
	- The political system of society , its class structure, economic system or level of economic development. 
	- Parties do know 
		- Citizens in society have different comprehnsive doctrine and plans of life.  
		- The society is under condition of moderate scarcity, there is enough to go around , but not enough for everyone to get what they want 
		- General facts and common sense about human social life, general conclusion of science, economics and psychology. 
	- The vigil of ignorance situates the representative of free and equal citizens fairly wrt another. The situation of parties emobodies reasonable conditions, within which parties can make a rational and all  well accepted principal of justice.  
- ##### First Principal
- All primary goods are available to all. 
- ##### Difference Principal
- Social and economic inequalities are to be aranged so that
	- a) There should be condition of fairl Equality of  oportunity 
	- b) Socio economic inequality is justfied if it is benefiting or reaping benefit to least advantage. 

- The first principal of equal basic liberty is to  be embodied in political constitution. While second principa applies to economic institution. The first principal affirms that all citizens should have familiar basic rights and liberty such as freedom of speech, right to vote etc.
- Second distinctive feature of rawls theory requires that citizens with same tallent and wilingness to use them. Have the same educational and economic opportunities regardless of whether they are born rich or poor. 
- Second part of second principal is the difference principal which regualtes the distribution of wealth and  income. Allowing inequality of wealth and income can lead to larger social product.  The diff. prin. allows inequality of wealth and income so long as that these will be to everyone advantage and specially to those who will be worsed off. 
- The difference principal thus expresses positive ideal and ideal of deep social unity. In a society that satisfies the difference principal in citizens knows that the economics work in everyones benefit. 
- Lexical Priority :
	- Princiapl of justice should be implemented in sequence wise manner. 
	- Next principal can not be implemented until unless first principal is achieved.
	- Sequence is fixed and must not be changed.
