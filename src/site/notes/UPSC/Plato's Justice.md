Date: 2022-06-22
Course:: [[UPSC/PSIR|PSIR]]

## Introduction: 
1. This statement reflects nature and construct of State. 
2. As [[UPSC/Plato|Plato]] identifies state as 
	 - Perfect
	 - Organic
	 - Natural
3. As he identified interconnecting organic relationship between human beings nature and state. 

##### State is individual writ large(15m,150words)
- State is individual write large: The inner principal of human mind work themselves out in social institution and are manifested. 
- The minds of individual and mind of states are identical: Life of state is life of men composing it. 
- Therefore instead of analyzing the human soul and considering justice there, [[UPSC/Plato|Plato]] studies it as it exist in general in the state. 
- State is formed of the individuals but in functional format therefore it is nothing but reflection of human nature. 

> Like State, Like Humans.
- In order to understand State, one needs to understand human nature. 
- Without understanding human nature one can't determine the function and needs of human beings and will not be able to figure who is best to fit to rule over them. 
- In order to create justice human nature firstly needs to be understood; state is magnification of individuals.
- **Same principles which provides justice  at the level of Individuals are good enough to provide justice at level of state as well.**

##### Plato's Argument 
- Justice is all about performing as per dominant natural trait. 
- Individual justice as well as collective justice. 
- Purpose of an individual is to get its highest form/Ideal Format 
- An individual can't get it alone. 
- State came into being for sake of good life.  => Highest form 
- Pre-condition is; State must be ideal state. 

##### Organic Theory of State
- State is space where human nature is reflected in its best form. 
- Human Nature biologically continue to evolve.
