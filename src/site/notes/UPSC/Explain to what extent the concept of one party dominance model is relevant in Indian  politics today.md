The concept of one-party dominance refers to a political system in which a single political party consistently holds a significant majority of political power and is able to govern without the need for a coalition with other parties. In India, the concept of one-party dominance has been relevant at various points in the country's history.

One example of one-party dominance in India was the period of Congress Party rule from 1947 to 1977, during which the Congress Party won every national election and held a majority in the parliament. During this time, the Congress Party was able to implement a number of significant economic and social policies, including land reform and the establishment of a mixed economy.

However, in recent years, the concept of one-party dominance in India has become less relevant. Since the 1980s, India has seen a shift towards a more multiparty system, with several parties competing for power at the national level. In the 2014 national elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a majority of seats in the parliament, but with a smaller margin, winning 282 seats out of a total of 543 seats. In the 2019 national elections, the BJP won a clear majority, winning 303 seats out of a total of 543 seats. The Congress Party, the main opposition party, won just 52 seats.

There are a number of factors that have contributed to the decline of one-party dominance in India. One factor is the decentralization of political power, with the rise of regional parties that have significant influence in specific states but may not have a national presence. According to political scientist Ashutosh Kumar, "the emergence of regional parties has had a profound impact on Indian politics, as they have challenged the dominance of national parties and have increasingly played a decisive role in government formation at the national level."

Another factor is the increasing diversity of the Indian electorate, with a growing number of voters supporting parties that represent specific communities or issue-based platforms. As political scientist Yogendra Yadav has noted, "the increasing social diversity of India has led to the emergence of issue-based politics, as different communities and groups have begun to demand greater representation and recognition."

In conclusion, while the concept of one-party dominance was once relevant in Indian politics, it has become less so in recent years due to the rise of multiparty competition and the decentralization of political power. While the BJP's victory in the 2019 national elections has restored some elements of one-party dominance, the multiparty nature of the Indian political system and the growing influence of regional parties mean that one-party dominance is not absolute.
