From a realist perspective in international relations, Thucydides' statement that "what matters is power and not appeals to justice, even God does not help, only self help works" captures a central tenet of realist thought: the belief that states are motivated primarily by their own self-interest and that they will act to maximize their own power in order to protect their own security and promote their own interests.

This idea is often referred to as the "national interest" and has been famously articulated by realist scholars such as Hans Morgenthau and John Mearsheimer.

According to realists, the international system is characterized by anarchy, meaning that there is no higher authority to enforce rules or mediate conflicts between states. In this context, states must rely on their own power and resources to protect themselves and advance their interests. 

From this perspective, appeals to justice and fairness may be seen as naive or even irrelevant, as states are primarily concerned with advancing their own power and security.

One example of this dynamic can be seen in the actions of great powers throughout history. Great powers, or states with a preponderance of military, economic, and political power, have often used their influence to shape the international system to their own advantage and to further their own interests. 

For example, the United States has frequently used its military and economic power to shape the international system and to protect its own interests, even when these actions have been criticized as violating international law or norms of justice.

While the pursuit of power is a central concern for states from a realist perspective, it is important to recognize that this pursuit is not without costs and consequences. States must carefully weigh the costs and benefits of their actions and consider the ways in which their pursuit of power may impact the broader international system and the welfare of other states. 

Realists such as Kenneth Waltz have argued that the pursuit of power can help to create a stable international system, but others such as Robert Jervis have argued that unchecked power can lead to conflict and instability.
