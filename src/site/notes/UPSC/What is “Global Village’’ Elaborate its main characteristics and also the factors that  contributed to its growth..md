"Global Village" is a term popularized by Marshall McLuhan in the 1960s, which refers to the idea that the world has become interconnected and interdependent through advances in communication and transportation technologies. 

The main characteristics of the global village include:

1.  Increased Connectivity: The world has become more connected, with the growth of the internet and mobile communications. This has enabled people to communicate and share information in real-time across the world.
    
2.  Cross-Cultural Interaction: The global village has brought people from different cultures together, enabling them to learn from each other and share their perspectives.
    
3.  Globalization of Economy: The world has become more integrated economically, with trade and investment flows connecting countries and businesses across the globe.
    
4.  Transnational Corporations: The growth of multinational corporations has enabled businesses to operate globally, reducing the significance of national borders.
    
5.  Standardization: The globalization of culture and commerce has led to a standardization of goods, services, and ideas across the world.

Factors contributing to the growth of the global village include:

1.  Technological Advancements: The rapid growth of the internet and mobile communications can be seen in the widespread use of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp, which connect people across the world in real-time.
    
2.  Economic Liberalization: The signing of free trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, has enabled businesses to operate and trade freely across borders.
    
3.  Political Changes: The end of the Cold War and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 marked a major shift in global politics, leading to greater cross-border cooperation and integration. One example of this can be seen in the European Union, which has brought together previously separated countries in a common market.
    
4.  Demographic Changes: The rise of a global middle class, increased migration, and globalization have all enabled people to experience different cultures and ways of life. For example, the growing number of international students studying abroad and the growth of multinational corporations have led to greater cross-cultural interaction and understanding.    

In conclusion, the global village refers to the interconnected and interdependent world created by advances in communication and transportation technologies. The growth of the global village has been driven by a combination of technological advancements, economic liberalization, political changes, and demographic shifts.
