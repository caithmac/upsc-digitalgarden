Hindu have had two tradition 
1. Dharmashastra 
2. Dandashaastra
Dharmashstra talks about various aspects of statecraft. The most important of which is Manu Smriti. Which deals with various topics. 
It talks about goals of life: Four Purusharthas. 
1. Dharma 
2. Artha 
3. Kama 
4. Moksha 
The 4 Purushrtas show that Hindus took life in comprehensive sense. They've neither ignore the material nor sensual pleasure. Hence it represents a balanced way of life. 
Concept of Ashram gives different stages of life with specific goals for each stages. 
1. Brahmacharya 
2. Grihastha 
3. Vanaprastha 
4. Sanyasa
It also has given origin of state, and has thought of it as quasi contractual theory. State is contracted between Man and God. And it came in effect because Matsyana was prevalent. Hence people requested Brahma and Brahma created Manu. 
It also gave ideals of Kingship. The kings only had divine personality unlike West where Kings had divine personality and Divine rights. Here the kings were also bound be Rajadharma. 
Arthshastra belongs to the tradition of Dandashastra. Its prime issue was state craft. However it also discusses dharma and we see the continutyy between Manu and Kautilya. 
Kautilya defines state craft as Arthshastra. He gives instruction to Kings on how to better run their kingdom. It included 
1. How to acquire new land
2. War, Strategies, Planning, Balance of Power, Geo Politics
He also talks about corruption and internal administration in depth. 
Indian Political thought also gave Buddhist Political Thought. Buddha can't be said to be a political thinkers in many words. Yet he had strong impact on generations of kings and leaders. 
Buddhism has came into being as anti to what Hinduism at that time had become. Buddhism was more egalitarian, socialist and republic in its thought. It envisaged equal status for all, unlike Hinduism which had become riddled with strict Varna-Jati and strong Brahmanical outlook. 
Many from Buddhist tradition wrote the best practices for a state and Kings, like Ashvaghosha and Asokvadan, They gave various features of an ideal king and ideal state.

>[!tip] Conclusion
