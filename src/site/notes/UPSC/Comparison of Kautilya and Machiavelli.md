- When [[Excalidraw/Vijigishu\|Vijigishu]] prepares for expedition in one direction, he has to take care of enemy situated at back 
- Kutilya calls enemy at back as - Parshva Nighra 
- Friend at back as - Akranada
- In this direction aslo, he gives sequence of Kings 
	- **Parshva Nighara** 
	- **Akranada**
	- **Parshva Nighara  Sara** 
	- **Akranada Sara**

- He gives two other kings 
	- **Udasina** (neutral)
		- Turkemenistan 
		- Switzerland 
		- [[Neutral state\|Neutral state]]
		- It is in the context of war. If other countries accept the status of any country as neutral, then that country has to give Equal acess to its teritory to both parties in war
		- Nepal aspires for neutral status. Nepals demand is against India's national interest. If UN recognises Nepal as neutral, in case of India-China war, both will have acess to its territory. At present, only India can use its territory during war under the agreement of 1950
	- **Madhyana**
		- Buffer state 
		- They are smaller state b/w two major powers. Their purpose is to avoid 2 major powers coming into state of direct confrontation 
		- Nepal is ideal buffer zone b/w India and China
		- [[UPSC/Kautilya\|Kautilya]] was of opinion that king should bring buffer state in his favour 
		- India has brought Nepal under its control by 1950 Agreement. However India lost strategic advantage when China occupied Tibet. Tibet was also an ideal buffer zone. 

- Max Weber : [[UPSC/Kautilya\|Kautilya]] is more of Machiavellion than [[Machiavelli\|Machiavelli]]. [[Machiavelli\|Machiavelli]] prince is harmless when compared to [[UPSC/Kautilya\|Kautilya]]'s king.  ^54ab16
