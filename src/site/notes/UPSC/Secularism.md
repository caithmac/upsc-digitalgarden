>[!todo]+ Introduction
>- Secularism is a principle which advocates the separation of religion from politics. 
>- Separation of government institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious institution and religious dignitaries. 
>- Religion should be separate from aspects of state and governance.
>- **Secularism implies not only the separation of religion and state but also religious freedom, the autonomy of religious groups, withdrawal of state sanction for religious norms and a minimization of religious groups as categories of public policy and as actors in public life.**
>> _“Secularism was equated with godlessness, an absence or denial of religious values, rather than a separation of church and state in order to guarantee religious freedom in pluralistic societies.”_
– **John Esposito, Islam**_

 | Equal Protection by state to all religions. Does not favour one religion over other. | Separation of state and religion as mutual exclusion i means both are mutually exclusive in their own spheres of operation |
 |                                                                                      |                                                                                                                            |

>- Firmly rooted in India's own socio-historical circumstances. 
>- Remarkable religious diversity in contrast to the mono-religious nature of western societies. 
>- India respect and recognizes the deep spritual and religious nature of Indian society and infused the principle of equality within the practics of religion. 
>- State has interfered from time to time to fix religions malpractices, and it has always been accepted by progressive voices of the societies. 
	>> -  Eg., Untouchability, Triple Talaq, UCC. 
> - Indian ideal of secularism clearly cautions against allowing religion to interfer in state matters. 
> - Disallowing mobilizing the electorate on religious lines for winning election. 
> - Indian state shall not have any state religion.

>[!cite] Court Cases
>- Stanislaus vs State of Madhya Pradesh case (1977), The Supreme Court held that the right to propagate religion (under Article 25) does not include right to forcible conversion as it may disturb public order.
>- Ratilal vs State of Bombay (1954), it was held that regulations by the state should not interfere with essentials of religion
>- St. Stephen’s College vs University of Delhi (1992), the court held that autonomy of a minority institution cannot be taken away as it will defeat the purpose of right to establish and administer educational institutions by minorities.
>- Church of God (Full Gospel) in India vs K. K. R. Majestic Colony Welfare Association (2000), it was held that as the right to religion is subject to public order, no prayers (through voice amplifiers or beating of drums) should be performed by disturbing the peace of others


>[!note] Conclusion 
>Thus realizing communal harmony without creating material and ideological foundations to generate and sustain it seems extremely difficult. The importance attributed to religious harmony is indeed logical, given the reality of a multi-religious society. But it is not sufficiently inclusive to reconcile the cultural differences. For realizing inclusiveness, cultural plurality is not sufficient; what is essential is cultural equality. Integral to the concept of secularism, therefore, is cultural equality; so also are democracy and social justice. Without these three interrelated factors – equality, democracy and social justice – secularism cannot exist as a positive value in society.
