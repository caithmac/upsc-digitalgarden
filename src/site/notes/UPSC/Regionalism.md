>> - ==Integration of princely states:== Many princely states were integrated with other princely state and british provinces to make one big state, people still continued to be loyal to their old territorial units. The Princes often recieved support and won election from their former territories.

#### Bases of Regionalism 
- ##### Geographical Base
	- Loyalties of citizens were torn between old territorial boundaries and new tweeitorial structures.

- ##### Historical and Social Base
- ###### History :
	- For support of regionalism - Heritage, Folklore, Myths and symbolism. 
	- Can't be considered as the most important basis of regionalism. 
	- Economic and political factors have combined with history to generate regionalism. 
- ###### Language :
	- Most important mark of identification. 
	- Language expresses the shared life, thought structure and value pattern of people. 
	- Linguistic homogeneity strengthens a positive movement. 
	- Establishment of [[State Reorganisation Commission, 1955|State Reorganisation Commission, 1955]]
	- Regionalism is closely associated with language but is not synonymous with regionalism. 
	- Maharashtra did form on basis of linguistic state. 
	- But North East india refers themselves as seven sister. 
	- Language is not the sole generator of regionalism. 
- ###### Caste : 
	- Important example of the caste factor providing impetus to linguistic regionalism can be seen in the case of Tamil Nadu. It gained ground as a result of non-Brahmin movement. 
- ###### Religion: 
	- Religion like caste does not play a significant role except when it is combined with dominance and linguistic homogeneity as in Punjab or fed on a sense of religious orthodoxy and economic deprivation as in Jammu and Kashmir.
- Language, caste and religion one can say that the study of regionalism in Punjab and Tamil Nadu makes it very clear that political movements for regional demands were carried out formally in the name of language but in reality they had substantive non-linguistic bases too. 
- ###### Economic Base: 
	- Economic factor is the crux of regional politics. 
	- India is developing cuntry, the resources are finite and hence equitable distribution is hard. Economic policies have led to regional imbalances and wide economic disparities among various regions resulting in discontentment among them. 
	- Movement of Jharkhand was on similar ground. 
	- And groing voice for Bodoland is also on basis of Economic base. 
	- Have usually assumed prime importance in regional politics. 
- ###### Politico-Administrative Bases: 
	- Doesn't create regionalism but only accentuates regionalism. 

##### Forms of Regionalism 
###### Demands for state autonomy 
- Mostly non-existent now. 
###### Inter-state regionalism: 
- Border dispute between two states. 
###### Son of soil theory: 
- Ties people to their place of birth and confers some benefits, rights, role and responsibilities on them. Which may not apply to others. 

##### Positive Impact of Regionalism
- Can lead to inter-group solidarity in a particular region. 
- In a globalized world, regionalism has given people a sense of identity. 
- Competition among different regions, propeling them to do better to improve the status of their regions. 

##### Negative Impact of regionalism
- Adverse affect on national integration. 
- Loyalty to a particula region remains stronger than loyalty to the nation. 
- Can be exploited and used for political leverage in order to garner votes. 
- Law and order situation is disturbed. 
- 

##### Is regionalism a threat to National Integration? 
- Not meerely a disintegration force. 
- Not opposed to national integration. 
- Can exist together in a creative partnership. 
- Stress the development of a region and national integration for the development of the nation as a whole. 
- This leads into a fedral and democratic system. 
- There should be healthy reconciliation between regionalism and nationalism. 
- Can make fedralism a greater success. 
- Regional communities will interact with federal government on the basis of more equal partnership. 
- Reduce the centralizing tendencies in a nation and power will shift from the centre to the states. 
- is quite natural that regional communities, who are conscious of their distinctive culture, should interact with federal government on the basis of more equal partnership.
