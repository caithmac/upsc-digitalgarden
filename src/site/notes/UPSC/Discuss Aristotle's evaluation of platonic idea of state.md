Aristotle's practical approach comes in conflict with Plato's vision of ideal state. 
- The rule of [[Philosopher King|Philosopher King]] is not practical
- Aristotle focuses on best practicable rather than best overall. 
- Property is not evil for Aristotle. 
- Those who have property have a stake in political system hence are more cautious about its stability and order. 
- Aristotle also disagrees on issue of Family, since for him man is social animal, platonic ideas appear barbaric where man is lone beast fending for his survivable. 
- If family and property were so wrong family and property these institution would have perished long ago. 
- Plato's view of justice is about organizing state. Aristotle simply focuses on redistributed corrective nature, which is more in conformity with needs of an actual society. 
- He is suspicious of capability of slave and women. 
- Where Plato prefers extremes of virtue and every man is dominated by one of the three traits, Reason., Courage and Appetite. 
- For Aristotle best individual is a balanced one informed with idea of golden mean.
