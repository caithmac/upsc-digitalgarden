As Whitehead had remarked "The entire western political thought is just footnote to Plato and Aristotle. "
Plato gives the conception of ideal state followed by these many scholars (all the scholars who agree with Plato)
Aristotle gives the conception of pragmatic state followed by these shcholars who belive him to be better. 


By analysis of the following debate, we realise that all the western political ideology be it captialism, socialism, communism or liberalism, all owe their begining to original debate of role of state given by Plato and Aristotle.
