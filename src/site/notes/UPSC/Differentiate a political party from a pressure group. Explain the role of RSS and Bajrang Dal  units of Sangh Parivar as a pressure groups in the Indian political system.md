A political party is an organized group of people who have the same ideology, aims, and objectives and seek to influence public policy by nominating and supporting candidates for public office. Political parties are typically involved in the process of campaigning for and winning elections, and they often hold a significant amount of power in the government.

On the other hand, a pressure group is an organization that seeks to influence public policy or legislation without seeking to win public office. Pressure groups can be found in many different areas, including politics, business, and social issues. They often use a variety of tactics, such as lobbying, public demonstrations, and media campaigns, to try to influence decision-makers and shape public opinion.

RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) and Bajrang Dal are units of the Sangh Parivar, which is a group of Hindu nationalist organizations in India. Both RSS and Bajrang Dal have been described as pressure groups that seek to influence the Indian political system and promote their nationalist ideology.

According to scholar Christophe Jaffrelot, "the RSS has always been a pressure group, not a political party, and has never contested an election." Jaffrelot goes on to say that the RSS has "sought to shape the political landscape from outside the system by providing an ideological foundation for the Hindu nationalist movement and by infiltrating existing political parties." Similarly, the Bajrang Dal has been described as a "militant" pressure group that has been involved in violent attacks against religious minorities in India.

Overall, the role of the RSS and Bajrang Dal as pressure groups in the Indian political system is controversial, with some seeing them as positive forces for national unity and others viewing them as divisive and discriminatory.
