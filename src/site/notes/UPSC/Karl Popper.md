# Context

## Body 
##### Karl Popper 
###### Enemy of open society 
- He accuses Plato of monopolizing military virtues and training for the ruling class and excluding the producer class from any political participation. 
- As per Popper justice for Plato is principle of class rule and class privileges. The state is just only if the rulers rule, workers work, slaves serves/.
- Even concept of Communism of Property and Wives denies basics of life like family and wealth to a large chunk of population. 
- For Popper Plato's political programmed is far from being morally superior to totalitarianism, is fundamentally identical with it. 
- Division of society is hard and fixed
- There is nothing beyond these two classes. 
- Role of every person is fixed for life. 
- No option of switch or change
- All Political powers belongs to [[UPSC/Philosopher King|Philosopher King]] - no one can say anything against him. 
- Orders are final and [[UPSC/Philosopher King|Philosopher King]] is not limited by his own orders. 
- No circulation; no space of evolution -> means -> closed society where nothing new will be allowed 
- There is monopoly of merit/quality
- Is a class rule not rule of law. 

###### Totalitarian 
- Above law
- Control over all aspect of life. 
- No one is above ruler. 
- All rights belong to him. 
- Monopoly of trades.
- Principal of class rule and class privileges.
- [[UPSC/Philosopher King|Philosopher King]] is holding final knowledge 
- His ordinance are not mightier than knowledge 
- He is above all laws; even laws made by him or her. 
- [[UPSC/Philosopher King|Philosopher King]] restrict everyone to remain in their domain and release order to follow it. 
- Against democracy. 
- 


## Criticism 
- Commentary with Popper and against him. 
- Bertrand Russell calls Plato a totalitarian.
- Levinson in support of Plato 

## Defense of Plato against Popper's critique
- Plato's state is not police state. Rather it is lead by rational and ethical ruler who had a life of education. training, dedication and renunciation.
- Since order in society can  destroy individual himself, Plato is concerned about order and society and rulers with well ordered souls. 
- The [[UPSC/Philosopher King|Philosopher King]] are denied even basic amenities like family and property. Plato's rule can be anything but not rule of privilege class. 
- Platonic state enabled the individual to fulfil himself to highest capability. Therefore, state was not end in itself but means. 

## Conclusion 
While Popper's critique of Plato is not without merit the philosophical defense for Plato's state also is valid. Platonic theory therefor has been rightly appraised by Whitehead's comment; "The entire western political thought is nothing but footnote to Plato and Aristotle." also summarized by Popper as, "One can be Platonic or anti-Platonic but never non-platonic."
