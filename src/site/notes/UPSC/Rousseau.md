A philosopher through his social contract criticised civilizational development for destroying human  nature and making human beings artificiall mechanistic. 
In his theorem criticised progress of science. 
- Progress of Science and Art had tended to degrade man moraly 
- Man by nature is good but becomes bad on account of corrupt institution which and unnatural civilation science creates. 
- It is progress of science that limited passion and promoted disbalance rationality. 
- It is the science and civilistation that created inequality, in his book 'Doscourses on the orgin and foundation of inequality' he argued science has helped to institutionalise institution of private property and civilisational values. 

##### Social Contract 
- Pourpose is to recover the original happines and incoence he firmly believes that fredom is essential and indenspinsiable condition for the development for potentiality of his nature, through contract he was trying to secure freedom of human being. 
- He argued that Art and Culture of european society was not helping human to grow accord to his true nature infact it is dehumanizing them.  
- Tried to establish perfect state for development of human being by bringing everyone under the rule of general will. 
- Man is born free but everywhere in chains. 
- Man itself is source of all evil. 
- Discuss Rousseau concept of inequality.
##### Human Nature 
- Rousseau found that there are two instincts which constitutes our original nature
	- Self love 
		- Law of nature is to attend to his own preservation.
		- "Human beings first care are those which he owes to himself."
	- Sympathy 
		- Along with self preservation we
		- Idea of family rest on this instinct. 
- These tow instinct will come into conflict, out of such continual conflict a new instinct is born, conscince. 
- Conscience Arisses to help maintain both instinct. 
- He further argued that because of science and technolgy and institution of property a new sentiment come into picture called reason. In the initial phase reason which helps us to know what is right or wrong was well balanced with conscience. Rousseau argued that consicenec and reason worked together to enable an individual to establish harmony between self love and sympathy. In the later stages this balance got disturbed, reason completely overpowers consciences and the feeling of self emerges as dominant instinct and it led to emergence of inequality and people lost their freedom. 
- Roussea in his social contract argued that balance between both of the instinct must be established by balancing reason and conscience in order to ensure this he narated a social contract among peole which led to establishment of **general will**. 
##### Concept of General Will 
- A person can be forced to be free. 
- General will be always right 
- Always working in a greater good. 
- Might be totalitarian in nature 

###### Features of Social Contract 
- Based on consent, General Will is outcome of  contract. 
- General Will is disinterested, 
	- Always at common good
	- It is concerned with those things which are common concern and not at all which are purely personal. 
- General will must be general not only in its purpose but also in its composition. And it must take into consideration of will of each member of community. 
- General will is based on unanimity, he clearly differentiated b/w general will and will of all. 
- Sum total of wills of individual includes actual and real will both. 
- General will is sum of actual will. 
- General will is unitarity and sovereign, it is collective person having a life, will and purpose of its own. 
- General will can not be defied/denied as it is sum of actual will. Denial of general will will be taken as act under the influence of real will. 
- General will represent popular sovereignty, it presents idea of direct [[UPSC/Democracy|democracy]], everyone is part of general will and becomes ruler at the same to be ruled. 
- General will is considered to be absolute, so few scholar identifies totalitarianism in it. 
###### Difficulties 
- General Will can become totalitarian. As there is no checks and balance and no right is recognized against the general will. 
- Possibility of misuse of theory of general will
-  General Will's application to practice is limited,
-  this theory diminishes the importance of government 
- It also encourages individualism. 
- Rousseau has been charged often of encouraging individualism that will end in anarchy. 
- General will is Leviathan with is head chopped off. 
	- Equaly powerful to Leviathen. 
	- Leviathen was above peoplel and identifiable. 
	- Rousseau's sovereign is actually people thesevels, not easy to identify sovereignity in one person or group of person. 
	- Rousseau's general will occupies a prominent place in development of theory of sovereignity, General will is more powerful than leviathan,
	- ROusseau originality consist in defining sovereignity with fullnes and precision of hobbes. 
	- ROussea soverign is not easy to locate in person or group of person. 
	- Roussea located it in general will and became the founder of popular soverignity. 
	- Roussea's soverign is everywhere and can not be identified in any particualr way , because it can be said that General WIll is Leaviathan head chopped off. 

>[!cite] Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains
>Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains." The opening sentence of [Rousseau's The Social Contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Contract) not only summarises his entire philosophical system, it also proves how important he still is today.
>
>Written in 1762, The Social Contract picks up where his Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men left off, defining natural man as being free and happy and living in the forest. Rousseau explains how man went from this state of autonomy to the modern condition, dominated by inequality, dependency, violence and unhappiness. There were positive aspects to this process too, he admits, including the creation of families, the discovery of tools and technology, and the building of cities and social organisations. Unfortunately, this also gives way to what Rousseau called the "right of the strongest", where a reign of inequality destroys man's original state of happiness and freedom. Humanity becomes alienated, and the Discourse on Inequality ends unhappily in general war.
>
>The Social Contract is an attempt to find a solution to this problem. For Rousseau, because of man's "perfectibility", the passage from a natural state to a social one is both an accident and necessary. Unlike animals, men are programmed to create and progress from one condition to the next. Rousseau discovers a way men can associate themselves with each other while maintaining their own individual freedom inside a social and political organisation. He calls that concept the "general will". Simply put, it is a form of association in which an individual alienates himself completely to the general will, and therefore regains his freedom in a political form. This of course has been criticised: some say it leads directly to dictatorship. Others, like Louis Althusser, say it is based on the premise that the people enter into a contract with nobody else but themselves – a logical impossibility.
>
>However, Rousseau believed that in the form of the general will, the alienation of man would transform itself into freedom – this makes him nothing less than the inventor of modern dialectics, uniting the opposing concepts of nature (or freedom) and society (or contract), in their own opposition. All of Rousseau's philosophy is an attempt to find a solution to the problem of alienation. For Rousseau, the only thing that made humans different from animals is his free will, something constantly placed in danger whenever man enters into society.
>
>As a revolutionary thinker, Rousseau understood that the general will, or the will of the people, should be sovereign – and that is the catch. It is here where we regain our freedom inside social organisation. Only the general will – general interest as opposed to private interest – guarantees man his autonomy. No society can be free unless individuals understand that the general will or general interest should prevail over their own individual one.
>
>Rousseau also wrote of the emergence of machines and the rise of technology. He was the first to say that nature has limited resources and that we are putting our own survival in danger by over-exploiting it.
>
>"Man is born free and everywhere is in chains." Centuries after that prophetic opening sentence, we should ask ourselves if we can afford to ignore Rousseau's warning, in a world dominated by flashing mobile phones and social media. Man may indeed be born free, but in the 21st century, the chains may be even harder to see.
