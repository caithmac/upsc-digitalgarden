Coalition politics, or the practice of multiple political parties coming together to form a government, has had a significant impact on the Indian political system.

Atul Kohli: One of the major impacts of coalition politics has been the formation of unstable and short-lived governments. In India, no single party has won an outright majority in the parliament since 1984. As a result, the ruling government has often been a coalition of parties, with each party bringing its own set of demands and priorities to the table. Paul Wallace and Sanjay Kumar - This has led to frequent power struggles and policy differences within the coalition, leading to the collapse of several governments.

As per Zoya Hasan, Another impact of coalition politics has been the erosion of the dominance of the major national parties. In the past, the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were the dominant parties, with the Congress ruling India for much of its post-independence history. However, the rise of regional parties and the need for coalitions has led to the fragmentation of the political landscape, with smaller parties playing a larger role in national politics.

Sunil Khilnani- Coalition politics has also led to the emergence of regional parties as significant players in national politics. In a coalition government, regional parties are often able to extract concessions and benefits for their states in exchange for their support. This has given regional parties more influence and has led to a decentralization of power in the political system.

Overall, coalition politics has had a significant impact on the Indian political system, leading to unstable governments, the erosion of the dominance of national parties, and the emergence of regional parties as key players in national politics.



## can you substantiate with scholarly views

Yes, there are several scholarly views on the impact of coalition politics on the Indian political system.

According to political scientists, one of the major impacts of coalition politics has been the formation of unstable and short-lived governments. For example, in a 2007 paper published in the journal Commonwealth & Comparative Politics, political scientists Paul Wallace and Sanjay Kumar argue that the fragmentation of the political landscape and the rise of regional parties has led to a "coalition era" in Indian politics, in which it has become increasingly difficult for any single party to win a clear majority in the parliament. As a result, the ruling government has often been a coalition of parties, leading to policy differences and power struggles within the coalition, and resulting in the collapse of several governments.

Another view is that coalition politics has led to the erosion of the dominance of the major national parties. For example, in a 2012 paper published in the journal South Asian History and Culture, political scientist Zoya Hasan argues that the rise of regional parties and the need for coalitions has led to the fragmentation of the political landscape and the erosion of the dominance of the Congress and the BJP. This has given smaller parties a larger role in national politics and has led to a decentralization of power in the political system.

Overall, there is a consensus among scholars that coalition politics has had a significant impact on the Indian political system, leading to unstable governments, the erosion of the dominance of national parties, and the emergence of regional parties as key players in national politics.

"The rise of regional parties and the emergence of a multiparty system in the 1980s has made it increasingly difficult for any single party to win a clear majority in the Lok Sabha (India's lower house of parliament). As a result, the ruling government has often been a coalition of parties, leading to policy differences and power struggles within the coalition, and resulting in the collapse of several governments."
