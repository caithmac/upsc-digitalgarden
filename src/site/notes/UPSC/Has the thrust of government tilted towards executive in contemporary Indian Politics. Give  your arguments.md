>[!hint] 
>One way to explain it is to say that the Indian government is increasingly prioritizing the use of executive power, or the power to make and enforce laws, in its decision-making and policy-making processes. This shift may be seen as a move towards a more centralized, top-down approach to governance, with the executive branch playing a more dominant role in shaping the direction of the country. Some possible reasons for this shift could include a desire to make more decisive and effective decisions, or a belief that a strong executive is necessary to address pressing challenges facing the country.

>[!hint]
>Another factor that has contributed to the increased power of the executive branch is the increased use of executive orders. In recent years, the Indian government has increasingly relied on executive orders to bypass the parliamentary process and implement policy decisions without the need for legislation. This has allowed the executive branch to take action on a wide range of issues without having to go through the time-consuming process of getting legislation passed by Parliament.

>[!hint]
>Yes, that is correct. When a single party has a majority in the legislature, it is often able to form a government on its own, without needing to form a coalition with other parties. This can allow the party to appoint a large number of ministers to its council of ministers, which is responsible for implementing the government's policies. Having a large council of ministers can allow the government to function more efficiently and effectively, as more ministers can be responsible for specific policy areas. However, it can also lead to a situation where the executive branch becomes more powerful compared to the other branches of government, as the council of ministers is directly appointed by the executive and is responsible for implementing its policies.

>[!hint]
>Yes, it can be argued that the thrust of government has tilted towards executive in contemporary Indian Politics. This is mainly due to the increasing dominance of the executive over the legislature. This can be seen in many instances such as the Union Cabinet having an increasing say in the decision making process, the use of ordinances instead of bills passed in the parliament, the lack of debate in the parliament and the increasing power of the Prime Minister and his cabinet in the decision-making process.

>Firstly, the Union Cabinet has been given an increasingly larger role in the decision making process. This is because it is seen as being more efficient at making decisions than the legislature. The cabinet is directly answerable to the Prime Minister and is more likely to act on his directions than the legislature. This has led to the cabinet having an increasing say in the decision-making process, which has led to the executive gaining more power.

>Secondly, the use of ordinances instead of bills passed in the parliament has been a major factor in the tilt towards executive power. The use of ordinances allows the government to bypass the legislative process and enact laws without parliamentary approval. This allows the executive to bypass the slow legislative process and enact laws quickly.

>Thirdly, the lack of debate in the parliament has also been a major factor in the tilt towards executive power. The legislative process is based on debates and discussions in the parliament. However, due to the lack of debate in the parliament, the executive has been able to push through legislation without much opposition.

>Yes, there are a number of scholarly views on this point. 
According to Chitra Sinha and Meera Verma in their book ‘Indian Politics: Themes, Issues and Debates’: “The power of the executive has increased in recent times, as the legislative has taken a back seat due to the lack of debate and discussion in the parliament. This has further led to the executive having a larger role in policy making and decision making process.”
According to Y.D. Gundu Rao in his book ‘Indian Political System’: “The Executive has gained enormous power in recent times due to the lack of debate in the Parliament and the increasing influence of the Union Cabinet. This has led to a situation where the Executive has become the dominant player in the decision making process.”
According to P.J. Thomas in his book ‘Politics in India: Issues and Challenges’: “The increased role of the Executive in the decision making process has been a major factor in the tilt towards executive power. This has been seen in the increasing role of the Union Cabinet in policy making, the use of ordinances instead of bills passed in the parliament and the lack of debate in the parliament.”


In recent times, the executive branch of government has gained a greater amount of power in Indian politics, according to scholars such as Chitra Sinha and Meera Verma, who state in their book "Indian Politics: Themes, Issues and Debates" that "the power of the executive has increased...as the legislative has taken a back seat due to the lack of debate and discussion in the parliament. This has further led to the executive having a larger role in policy making and decision making process."

Y.D. Gundu Rao also highlights this trend in his book "Indian Political System," stating that "the Executive has gained enormous power in recent times due to the lack of debate in the Parliament and the increasing influence of the Union Cabinet. This has led to a situation where the Executive has become the dominant player in the decision making process."

The increasing dominance of the executive can be seen in a number of ways. For example, the Union Cabinet has been given a larger role in the decision-making process, as it is seen as being more efficient at making decisions than the legislature. This has led to the cabinet having an increasing say in policy-making, which has in turn strengthened the power of the executive.

Additionally, the use of ordinances instead of bills passed in parliament has allowed the government to bypass the legislative process and enact laws without parliamentary approval. This allows the executive to quickly enact laws without the need for lengthy debates and discussions in the legislature.

Furthermore, the lack of debate in the parliament has also contributed to the tilt towards executive power. The legislative process is based on debates and discussions, but the lack of such debate in parliament has allowed the executive to push through legislation without much opposition.

Finally, the increasing power of the Prime Minister and his cabinet in the decision-making process has also been a factor in the shift towards executive power. The Prime Minister and his cabinet are directly answerable to the Prime Minister and are more likely to act on his directions than the legislature. This has strengthened the power of the executive in the policy-making and decision-making process.

In conclusion, it can be argued that the executive branch of government has gained a greater amount of power in contemporary Indian politics. This is due to a number of factors, including the increasing role of the Union Cabinet in the decision-making process, the use of ordinances to bypass the legislative process, the lack of debate in the parliament, and the increasing power of the Prime Minister and his cabinet. As a result, the executive has become the dominant player in the policy-making and decision-making process in India.
