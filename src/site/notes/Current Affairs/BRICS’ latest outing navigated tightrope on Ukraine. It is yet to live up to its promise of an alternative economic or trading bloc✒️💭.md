##### What to read and why? 

_Know about the outcomes of the [[BRICS|BRICS]] summit and future prospects ._
- This was the 14th summit of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa grouping set up in 2009
-  hosted by China this year
- For India, BRICS was always about its commitment to building non-western alliances, but this time it was, more, an international balancing act.
- President Putin’s proposal for an alternative reserve currency was received with caution.
- BRICS has yet to live up to its promise of an economic or trading bloc that can offer alternatives to developing countries. The New Development Bank, or the BRICS bank, is yet to catch speed as a multilateral lender of standing
