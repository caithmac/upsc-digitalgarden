The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has played an important role in promoting regional peace and security through economic cooperation and trade. Some of the key contributions of ASEAN in this regard include:

1.  Fostering economic integration: ASEAN has been successful in promoting economic integration in Southeast Asia, including through the creation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). This has helped to promote economic growth and stability in the region and has helped to reduce tensions between member states.
    
2.  Promoting peace and security: ASEAN has played an important role in promoting peace and security in Southeast Asia, including through the resolution of territorial disputes and conflict in the region. ASEAN's commitment to the peaceful resolution of conflicts has helped to create a stable and secure environment in the region.
    
3.  Encouraging trade and investment: ASEAN has taken steps to promote trade and investment among its member states, including through the signing of free trade agreements with other countries and regions. This has helped to promote economic growth and stability in the region and has helped to reduce tensions between member states.
    
4.  Improving regional connectivity: ASEAN has launched several initiatives aimed at improving regional connectivity, including through the development of transportation and communication networks. This has helped to enhance economic cooperation and trade in the region and has helped to reduce tensions between member states.
    

In conclusion, ASEAN's role in promoting regional peace and security through economic cooperation and trade has been significant. However, the organization will need to continue to work towards addressing challenges and obstacles that are hindering the further integration of the region.
