Balance of power theory is a traditional approach in international relations that emphasizes the role of material power, such as military and economic resources, in shaping the relations between states.

This theory posits that states will balance against a rising power to maintain a balance of power and prevent any one state from dominating the international system. 

While this theory has been influential in understanding the relations between states, more recent scholarship in the field of international relations, particularly within the constructivist tradition, has emphasized the importance of non-material factors, such as norms and identities, in shaping state behavior and the international system.

Norms refer to the shared beliefs, values, and practices that shape how states interact with one another. They are informal rules that guide behavior, and they can be either formal or informal. They can be expressed through laws, customs, or even through language. Norms are important in international relations because they shape the way states act and interact with each other.

For instance, the norm of sovereignty, which is the belief that states have the right to govern themselves without external interference, has traditionally constrained the ability of states to intervene in the domestic affairs of other states, even when faced with gross human rights violations. This can be seen in the international community's reluctance to intervene in the Syrian Civil War, despite widespread human rights abuses by the government.

Identity is another key constructivist concept that refers to the way that states define themselves and their place in the world. It is the way in which a state understands its position in the international system and the way it views its place in the world. The identity of a state as a democracy, for example, can shape its foreign policy decisions and the way other states interact with it.

Democratic states often have shared values such as respect for human rights, rule of law, and democratic governance. This identity can lead a state to support democratic movements in other countries or to oppose authoritarian regimes. The United States, for example, has often identified itself as a leader of the democratic world and has intervened in other countries to promote democracy.

Another example of how norms shape state behavior and the international system is the norm of human rights. This norm has become increasingly relevant in the international arena and has led to the creation of various human rights organizations, such as the United Nations Human Rights Council, which aims to promote and protect human rights globally. This norm also has led to the creation of various human rights conventions and protocols, such as the Convention Against Torture, which have been ratified by many countries and have become an important part of the international legal system.

In conclusion, while balance of power theory traditionally focuses on material power, recent constructivist scholarship highlights the importance of non-material factors such as norms and identities. These ideational factors shape state behavior in ways that go beyond the traditional focus on material power. Norms, such as the norm of sovereignty and the norm of human rights, and identities, such as a state being a democracy, play a significant role in shaping the international system. Therefore, in order to fully understand the dynamics of international relations, it is important to consider both material and non-material factors.
