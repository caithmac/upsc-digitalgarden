>[!error] Introduction 
>Revolutionary Phase in Indian nationalism is mostly clouded by few names is a story of violence, assassination, and bombings. A saga of bravery and sacrifice. They were not merely troublesome for the Raj, they were dangerous for Raj's existence.

Revolutionary of India varied in their thinking. Some were adherent Marxist, who wanted a total revolution and freedom from bourgeoise . Some were religious, who found the presence of British on Indian soil antithetical.  
But what all they agreed on was that, British would never leave India without the use of violence. They knew that the oppression Raj meted out to the masses had to be returned with interest. 

Bhagwati Charan Vohra wrote his famous book, "The Philosophy of Bomb" in response to Gandhi's "The Cult of Bomb" after the failed attempt on the life of Viceroy Lord Irwin..
He had argued that Gandhi knew nothing of  "mass" which he talks about. He accused Gandhi of elitism and that his 'experiences' were merely  imposition of his own personal beliefs upon masses. 
The militant revolutionary argued that they were most connected to the masses and peasants. They knew of their struggle and their frustration. 

Hindustan Republic Army, faced set back after Kakori Robbery. Hence Chandrasekhar Azad revamped HRA Hindustan Socialist Republican Association and started to move away from individual heroic action and work on socialist principle. But after death of Sher-i-Punjab Lala Lajpat Rai, HSRA assassinated the police officer Saunders responsible for Rai's death. And they justified it with that "he was part and parcel of that inhuman and unjust order which has to be destroyed"

Association's methods were diametrically opposite to that of Gandhi's nonviolent resistance movement. Gandhi was against the revolutionary activity. He maintained his stance that we can achieve freedom with Ahimsa and satyagraha. He also wrote harsh critique of HSRA "The cult of bomb."
He also marked revolutionary "cowards" and "dastardly"


>[!tip] Conclusion 
>Overall, the militant and revolutionary movements during the Indian freedom struggle had a very different approach to Gandhi and his followers. While the militants believed that violence was necessary to achieve their goals, Gandhi and his followers believed that non-violence was the only moral and effective way to resist oppression and achieve independence.
