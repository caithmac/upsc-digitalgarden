##### Introduction 
 Hobbes says, only positive law can bring peace. It is definite and comes with power of punishment. If there is no fear of punishment, man will not obey law. Therefore, he establishes that fear is the sole basis of authority. 
##### Main Body 
Hobbes argument could be seen in context to International Laws and International Forum. It is in state of total anarchy. Given the fact that international laws are weak, hardly gets implemented and are voluntary.
According to Hobbes that the law without fear of punishment cannot be called a law in proper sense. In state of nature there was law, called natural law. However, natural law was insufficient to establish order.  Hence the state of nature was "nasty,, poor, brutish and short." Natural law depends on the reason of man. If man follows natural law, there will be peace. However, man has limited reason and his passion dominate over his reason. As Tuck said "Conflict arose due to independency of human judgement". 
##### Conclusion 
Thus the only way to lasting attain peace was through a covenant leading to the establishment of state with a sword.
