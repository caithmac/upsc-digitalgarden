- Hannah Arendt was one of the modern political thinker who revised century old methods of Aristotle. 
- In her political theory she tried to answer 
	- Nature of politics, ideal life of citizerns, what is freedom, what iss power. 
	- She also explained emergence of totalinarism. She analysed impact of modernism and capitalism over human being. 
- Her political philosophy can not be charectrised in terms of traditional categories of conservatism, liberalism or socialism. Nor her thinking be termed as communatarian. She is critique of representative democracy but stresses on civic engagement and political delibration. 
- She separates morality from politics but at the same time praises revolutionary tradition. 
- She is advocate of fundamental human rights along with right to action and critique of all forms of political community based on traditional ties as well as those based on religious, ethinic and racial identity. 
- She did not conceive politics as means for satisfaction of individual preference. 

> [!error] Hannah's conception of Politics
> Her conception of politics is based on idea of active citizenship, that is, on the value and importance of civic engagements and collective delibrations about all matters affecting political community, politics finds its authentic expression whenever citizen gather together in public space to delibrate to decide about matter of collective concern. Political activity is valued not because it would lead to agreeement or to shared conception of good,but because it enables each citizen to exercise his or her powers of agency to develop the capacities for judgement and to attain by concerted action some measure of political efficy.

- She through by her concept of vita activa that is three categories which coresponds to three categories of our being in world, 
	- work, 
	- labour and 
	- action. 
- **Labour** is the activity which is tied to human condition of life. 
	- Labour is judged by its ability to sustain human life, to cater to our biological needs of consumption and reproduction. 
	- Labour is a cyclical repeated process that carries with it a sense of utility. 
- **Work** : It is the activity tied to condition of worldness. 
	- Work is judged by its ability to build and maintain an article/world fit for human use. 
	- Work is inherently public. It creates an objective and common world which both stands between humans and unite them. 
- **Action** is the activity tied to condition of plurality. It is judged by its ability to disclose to identy of agent, to affirm the reality of world, and to actualise our capacity for freedom. 
	- For her each activity is autonomous and having its own distinct principle and of  being judged by different criteria. 
- She cosiders the three activity of labour , work and action equally necessary to a complete human life. In sense that each contribute in its own distinctive way in realization of our human capacity. She considers that those who are engaged in and limited upto labour work is animal labouran. 
- She prefered vita activa that is life of action of vita contemplativa, i.e life of philosophical thinking. 
- Concern of vita activa are neither superior nor inferior to those of vita contemplativa nor they are same. Plato and Aristotle were more focused on vita contemplitava rather than vita activa, and they consider the former superior to later. 

####  Theory of Action 
- For her, action is highest activity of human beings life. Action is essentialy associated to the condition of plurality and leds to disclose newness of the agent. The two central centre feature of action are freedom and plurality, for her freedom is not ability to choose between set of alternatives, ratherr by freedom she means capacity to begin or to start something new. To do unexpected with which all human beings are endowed with virtue of being born. 
- Action as a realisation of freedom is therefore rooted in natality, in the fact that each birth represent new begining and introduction of novality to the world. 
- For her action belongs to public realm and it is political phase of ones life, in her words
   > "Men are free as long as they act, neither before or after: far to be free and to act are same thing."
- Plurality is not only presence of many but engagement of many. 
- Freedom can not be achived in isolation. Action needs plurality in same way performance artist needs audience. 
- For her modernity is categroised by loss of world, by which she means restricition or elimination of the public sphere of action. And speech in favour of the private word of introspection and private pursuit of economic interest. 
- Modernity is age of mass society. 
- Modernity is leading to blurring the distinction between public and private. Animal Labouran over Humo Faber. 
- The ideal man is Zonn Politikon. 
- Modernity is age of beuracratic administration and anonymus labour rather than politics and action. Of elite domination and manipulation of public opinion. 
- She criticised even capitalism which is root cause of shrinking of public space and expansion of private space. Capitalism lead to economic sphere of life and it covers social as well as political life. 

##### Rise of totalitarianism. 
- In her book the "*The Origins of Totalitarianism*" she analysed rise of hitler and stalin. 
- She understood totalitaranism in its way of functioning. 
- She describes totalitarinsim as new form of government as it is different way of political subjugation, despotism, dictatorship, authoritanism use terror to subjugate politcal rivalary, but tolitaranism uses terror to subjugate mass. 
- Violence is just means but in totalitarianism it become an end in itself an objective in itself. 
- Totalitarian regime perform violence for sake of violence/ n
- Tot. get expressed in values, feelings and thought. Other form of govt. might control speech and certain freedom but tot. tries to control our thought and feeling by implanting discrimanatory and violent idea. 
	- Tot. regime use racial superiority or identity based superiority. 
	- In tot. state capitalism shift focus on material sphere rather than political sphere. 
	- there is complete decline of citizen participation and delibration. 
	- There is gradual decline of public life and more dependecny on beuracrat and technocrat , propoganda, manipulation were the main tool of totalitarainism. and 
### Banality of Evil 
- "Duty is duty" 
- Her idea is that when people do not think before acting
- Absence of  any parameter to judge their actions or activity. 
- Imapct of both becomes - activity becomes ordinary(common belief or idea)
- When the activity becomes banal - it leads to peoples participation. 
#### Idea of Revolution 
- Revolution creates universal category where all participants have a uniform understanding of the system or the value created at the time. 
- It always lead to creation of public space. 
- Hannah's understanding of revvolution is dfifferent from  both [[UPSC/Karl Marx\|Karl Marx]] and [[UPSC/Liberalism\|Liberalism]] understanding and interpreatation of revolution. 
- She critisized liberal revolution that it fails to make liberty as an  integrate value  all. In other word failed to create public space for liberty. 
- Marxist revolution was critisized for not creating universal category for everyone. 
- For Hannah Arendt revolution creates universal category. It helps to create public space and enhance political capacity of participants. 
- A political revolution helps to display and evolve fundamental political capacity of individual acting together for establishment of public space of freedom.
- She stresses that revolution helps to generate a permanenet political space in which activity of delibration, descion are coordinated and coordinated action are exercised.
