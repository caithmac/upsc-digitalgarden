>[!error] Introduction 
>Peasant insurrection  in the past and in contemporary times have been spontaneous and with leaders arising out of the society. They have been against oppressive taxation, oppressive regime and other forms of injustices.  They have been locally driven rather than being led by outside forces and support at many a times. Peasantry had for the longest time been an autonomous force.

One example of such an autonomous peasant uprising is Indigo Revolt of  1859. It was summer time when Ryots of Bengal and Bihar refused to grow indigo. They were discontent with the planters and demanded for better working condition. R C Dutt has said, 'the struggle for land right and social justice have been a common characteristic of peasantry movement in India and is essential for attaining equitable society. 
The impetus to revolt against the British came from within the society. Rajender Lahiri and Lokenath Bal were young peasant who first organised boycott and agitation. Later the peasant started to band together and agitate. And it was later on successful of freeing the peasantry from clutches of indigo plantation. 
Another example of autonomous uprising would be Telangana Rebellion against Nizam of Hyderabad. Though it was led by Communist Party of India, majority of agitation remained decentralized and locally-driven. They fought for their rights. against oppression and exploitation of ruling class, bravely.
The most controversial of peasant revolt though has been the Naxalite Movement, what started from a small village had one time enveloped many state of India and still continues till today. It has its own shortcoming but it demands for land rights and equitable society while preserving their way of life. 

>[!tip] Conclusion
>Peasantry movement have shaped Indian history and still remain as a reminder of struggle for equality and justice. It has been a source of inspiration for other group and community to come forward and put forth their legitimate demands.
