# Modern Liberalism
##### Positive Liberalism/Welfare State
- Emerged after evaluating exploitative impact of [[UPSC/Classic Liberalism|Classic Liberalism]]
- Industrial Revolution backed by [[UPSC/Classic Liberalism|Classic Liberalism]] led to high inequality, inhuman working condition and overall complete deterioration of human life. 
- [[UPSC/Socialism|Socialism]] , [[Marxism|Marxism]] promoted idea of [[UPSC/Justice|Justice]] available to every and each society. 
- Due to this immense pressure a new form of liberalism, [[UPSC/Positive Liberty|Positive Liberty]]/ Welfare State/ [[UPSC/Modern Liberalism|Modern Liberalism]]
- [[UPSC/T H Green|T H Green]], [[UPSC/Laski|Laski]], [[Bosanquet|Bosanquet]], [[UPSC/Hobbhouse|Hobbhouse]], founded intelectual root of modern liberalism. 

###### Justification for Welfare State
- Man is a part of social whole and liberty could be secured only so long as they could be reconciled with social good. 
- Liberty of a person should be compromised for social good. Led to emergence of [[UPSC/Positive Liberty|Positive Liberty]](restrictive liberty in favor of social good)
- Societies are considered potentially harmonious and ordered structure in which all social classes work for the common good. There is a societal good apart from thus individual good can not be achieved without social good.. Led to emergence of compromising individual liberty in favor of society which extended role of state. 
- Liberty in the society implied adjustment of mutual claims that are made possible through a system of rights. In order to adjust mutual claims state has to play a positive role by restriction and extension on liberty. 
- Liberty was not merely absence of restraint but condition necessary for free and full development of self(self development holds a purpose). State helped to achieve that purpose with restriction and extension of liberty. 
- Equality provided the basis through which liberty comes to acquire a positive meaning. Liberty and equality are complimentary not contradictory. 
- The state is an instrument for the development of human personality for welfare measures. The state has positive character and is capable of performing socially useful function.

# Neo-Liberalism
Neo-Liberalism believes in certain ideas 
- Individualism - Rationalism
- Individual Rights
- Spontaneous order 
- Minimal state 
- Free Market
- Natural Harmony of state

Idea of Neo Liberalism was well promoted by Hayek, Friedman, Aynrand, Robert Nozick. 

##### Phases of Neo-Liberal Discourses
1. Emergence of Neo-Liberal Policies (1970s)
   - Was characterized by heavy pro market policy mainly in northern states. 
   - This phase reflected era of rolling back functions of state in all aspect of life
   - This phase witnessed interventions like structural adjustment policy. - cut in food subsidies, social spending, development of corporate welfare, capital market deregulation and cut in unnecessary expenditures from public budget. 
   > This phase also witnessed rise of social and protest movement. 
   
2. Washington Consensus(1980s)
   -    This phase witnessed consolidation of neo liberal policies which has been popularly termed as Washington consensus. Washington consensus has impacted on economic policies of afro-asian-latin country. Core principle are as below. 
   - Fiscal Discipline
   - Tax reforms
   - Financial Liberalization 
   - Trade Liberalization 
   - Exchange Rates 
   - Deregulation 
   - Property Rights 
>Neera Chandoke summaries'
>The state both in north and the 3rd world country should withdraw from the social sector. 
>The market should be access to all spheres of life and social reproduction and thus be free from all constraints. 
>People should organize their own socio economic reproduction instead of depending of state. 

3. Post Washington Consensus(1990s-present)
   - In third phase major world economic and non-economic institution are discussing the problem of governance. 
   - State mechanism should be more focused on delivering prescribed services rather than socio economic sphere of life.

##### Neo- Liberalism State
- State should be minimal state and must be limited to function of providing security against force theft fraud at the same time enforcement of contract.  
- State must be there to promote the interest of everyone mainly in economic terms. 
- Neo-Liberals support workfare state against welfare state. 
>As per neo-liberals idea behind workfarism is poverty , unemployment doesn't occur because there are few jobs but because unemployed people are ill suited to jobs or who do not have economic ideas vibrant. 
>Libertarian state has to provide all such activities which leads to consolidation of individual rights establishing free markets and establish peace. 


>[!error] Concept of Robert Nozick is considered to be best explanation of neo-liberal state
> 1. All individual have inalienable rights independent to society. They are not dependent over the state or society for possessing of the individual rights. 
> 2. Function of state is to ensure there should not be violation of this inalienable right of individual. Nozcik believe in "Nightwatchman state"
> 3. Liberty must get priority over equality. Function of state must be limited only to ensuring exercise of liberty.  
> 4. He categorically instructed state not to go for [[Progressive Tax|Progressive Tax]] , Public Healthcare. State intervention means both ones resources and ones self. Seizing the result of some ones labor is equivalent to seizing hours from him and directing various activities thus welfare state is threat to liberty and independence of individual. 
> 5. [[The minimal state is inspiring as well as right|The minimal state is inspiring as well as right]]. What is important is that state must not use coercive apparatus for purpose of getting some citizens other and prohibit activity of other for their own good and protection. 


>[!error] Hayek's View 
>
> 1. His view support neo-liberalism
> 2. Liberty or freedom of a person is non coercion and he must not be subject of arbitrary will of another person. 
> 3. Liberty must not be confused with any other meaning of freedom.
> 4. Absence or presence of a freedom can not be sufficient condition of liberty. Liberty is bigger condition which enable a person to act as per his will without being under arbitrary will of either state or individual. 
> 5. State might emerge as a threat to liberty in this way freedom from constraints of state is condition of liberty. 
> 6. In order to promote liberty state should be confined to minimal work and to promote free competition and must not take cohesive measure. 
> 7. Hayek further argued that equality is essentially absence of constraints and equality of opportunity. Thus restricting once liberty will minimize equality of opportunity.  
> 8. He further argued that there is substantial difference between people's talent and skill. Any effort to bring equality other than equality of opportunity will bring inequality. 
> 9. Any attempt to bring equality other than equality of opportunity can not be done without force and will lead to limitation on liberty. States attempt to bring equality other than equality of opportunity is coercive in nature and will deprive person of liberty and freedom. 
> 10. Social Justice is a mirage.
