##### Evolution of Plato's Education System
- Equality of opportunity -> Men and Women get to harness their capability 
- Education System is of all round development 
- Theoretical as well as practical 

###### Criticism 
- Stresses more on administration and rulers
- More opportunity available to two classes
- Aims to produce ideal philosopher not man of action 
- More emphasis on Maths/Philosophy not on literature 
- Timer period of 35 years- Expensive and Hazardous
- After passing through such long process it will be difficult for the guardians to maintain efficiency as desired by Plato 
- as outcome of education all men/women do not posses equal  capacity for virtue therefore all are not entitle to participate in function of government on  basis of equality.
