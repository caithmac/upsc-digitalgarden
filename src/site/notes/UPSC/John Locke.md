## Two Treatise on Civil Government.
- First Treaty critiqued Robert Filmer's "Divine Theory of King" written in book Patriarcha 
- Filmer supported political and religious doctrine of royal and political legitimacy
	- As it says King or Monarch is not subject to any earthly authority because it derives its power the will of god. 
	- King can not be judged or ordered either by people or aristocracy but only by God. 
	- People don't have any right to protest or resist and only god can judge an unjust king. 
	- Protest against kings is protest against god and it creates a disrespectful act. 
- Filmer rejected idea of social contract and argued that man is not born outside or before a state or society. This social contract is illogical even if people enter into contract but next generation is not part of it.
- Lock argues that there is no evidence that the God has given any authority to any King or authority. 
- Even if we agree God did that, then there is a conclusive prove that God has allowed Adam to pass the authority to his son or successor. 
- There is a problem in identifying who are the real successor. 
- Locke finally says so much time has passed since supposedly God gave authority to Adam, that the event itself has lost relevance and we need a new contract to establish new rules of authority 
- Locke in his **second treaty of civil Government** explained that "Man being by nature is all free, equal and independent, no one can be put out of this state, and subjected to political power of an other, without his own consent." He further explained state of nature. Human nature is good helpful, people live in harmony and help each other. Optimistic view of human nature. Human being is self centered but also has reason. *Human being is worried about his own interest but at the same time he takes care of other as well.* State of nature is condition is state of peace, goodwill, mutual assistance and preservation. Locke identified 3 natural right, life, liberty and natural right. He identified laws of nature as inner morality that determine behavior of people. Reason is the core of law of nature. *Men are rational and everyone treats other as they would treat themselves.*
- As per Locke state of nature proved to be inconvenient. Locke identified two major inconvenience.
	- Common authority to interpret law, at the same time implement those law. There was always threat that everyone can become judge of its own case that is violation of natural justice.

##### Concept of Property 
- According to Locke right to property is most important and crucial right, social contract has been done to save this property and even state can not impose any limitation without the consent of owner of property. Right to property is intimately connected with right to life and liberty as it is necessary consequence. Sometimes Locke sums up all natural right in the right to property. Man creates property by mixing his labor with the object of his nature. In the beginning objects of nature all the things were held in common but common ownership is not enough to satisfy their need. Man must mix his labor with his resources provided by nature to enable him to make use of them in a more effective and profitable way.  Sincle man owns his own personality, his body and limbs, mind, the object with which he mixes his labor becomes his own property by right. 
- Labor theory of Value 
- Possesive Individualism 
- According to Locke labour not only creates property but it also determines value of property. He said that 90% value of propety must be determined on basis of labor. Locke puts three limitation over property. 
	1. Labor limitation 
	2. Utility-sufficiency limitation 
	3. Spoilage 
- Locke doesnt believes that man has unlimited right of appropriation. 
- Many critics have found these right to be verbal and in favor of accumulation of unlimited property . Macpherson criticised Locke by arguing that -
	-  locke made labor a commodity to purchase and sell and made it rightful for a man to appropriate the product of other men labour. 
	- Introduction of currency which allows man to exchange goods for money,removes the limitation imposed by non spooilage principle 
	- Locke not only justifies unequal property but approves of unlimited individual appropriation. 
	- Macpherson concludes that Locke is oresented as an idelegoue of Possesive Individualism of market economy and disctatorship of bourgeoisie. He is seen as typical spirit of captilism. 
- John Plamentz ciritic
	- Locke as pro-captialist and anti-people. He further said that limitation imposed by locke are either irrelevant or inadequate. 
- [[UPSC/I Berlin|I Berlin]] , Alan Ryan, Richard Ascraft,John Dun

	- John Plamentaz > Locke was the first of the liberal of our era.
