1. The Deccan Riots of 1875: This peasant uprising was sparked by a combination of high taxes, oppressive landlords, and the British colonial government's failure to address the grievances of the peasantry. The uprising was led by local leaders and spread across the Deccan region of India.

2. The Indigo Revolt of 1859-60: This revolt was led by the peasantry of Bengal against the British-backed indigo planters. The peasants were protesting against the oppressive and exploitative practices of the planters, such as forced labor and unfair wages.

3. The Kuka Movement of 1872-73: This movement was led by the Sikh peasantry of Punjab against the oppressive and exploitative practices of the British colonial government. The peasants were protesting against high taxes, forced labor, and the confiscation of their lands.

4. The Santhal Rebellion of 1855-56: This rebellion was led by the Santhal people of Bihar against the oppressive and exploitative practices of the British colonial government. The peasants were protesting against high taxes, forced labor, and the confiscation of their lands.


Peasant insurrection in India has been a part of the country’s history since ancient times. It has been a form of protest against oppressive rulers, oppressive taxes, and other forms of injustice. In the past, peasant insurrections have been led by outside leaders, such as the Marathas in the 18th century, or the British in the 19th century. However, there have also been many instances of peasant uprisings that have been autonomous of outside intervention. 

One example of such an autonomous peasant uprising is the Kuka Rebellion of 1872. The Kuka Rebellion was a revolt by the Sikh peasants of the Punjab region against the oppressive policies of the British colonial government. The rebellion was led by Baba Ram Singh, a Sikh religious leader, and was largely a peaceful protest against the oppressive taxes and other forms of injustice imposed by the British. The rebellion was ultimately unsuccessful, but it showed that the Sikh peasants were capable of organizing and leading a successful revolt without outside intervention. 

Another example of an autonomous peasant uprising is the Telangana Rebellion of 1946-1951. This rebellion was led by the peasantry of the Telangana region of India against the oppressive policies of the Nizam of Hyderabad. The rebellion was led by the Communist Party of India (CPI) and was largely a peaceful protest against the oppressive taxes and other forms of injustice imposed by the Nizam. The rebellion was ultimately successful, and it showed that the peasantry of Telangana were capable of organizing and leading a successful revolt without outside intervention. 

Finally, the Naxalite Movement of 1967-present is another example of an autonomous peasant uprising. The Naxalite Movement is a Maoist-inspired rebellion led by the peasantry of India against the oppressive policies of the Indian government. The movement is largely a peaceful protest against the oppressive taxes and other forms of injustice imposed by the Indian government. The movement has been largely successful, and it has shown that the peasantry of India are capable of organizing and leading a successful revolt without outside intervention. 

In conclusion, peasant insurrection in India has been a part of the country’s history since ancient times. While some of these uprisings have been led by outside leaders, such as the Marathas in the 18th century or the British in the 19th century, there have also been many instances of peasant uprisings that have been autonomous of outside intervention. Examples of such autonomous uprisings include the Kuka Rebellion of 1872, the Telangana Rebellion of 1946-1951, and the Naxalite Movement of 1967-present. These uprisings have shown that the peasantry of India are capable of organizing and leading successful revolts without outside intervention.
