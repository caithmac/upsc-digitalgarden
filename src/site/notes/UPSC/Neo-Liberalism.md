Idea of Neo Liberalism was well promoted by Hayek, Friedman, Aynrand, Robert Nozick. 

##### Phases of Neo-Liberal Discourses
1. Emergence of Neo-Liberal Policies (1970s)
   - Was characterized by heavy pro market policy mainly in northern states. 
   - This phase reflected era of rolling back functions of state in all aspect of life
   - This phase witnessed interventions like structural adjustment policy. - cut in food subsidies, social spending, development of corporate welfare, capital market deregulation and cut in unnecessary expenditures from public budget. 
   > This phase also witnessed rise of social and protest movement. 
   
2. Washington Consensus(1980s)
   -    This phase witnessed consolidation of neo liberal policies which has been popularly termed as Washington consensus. Washington consensus has impacted on economic policies of afro-asian-latin country. Core principle are as below. 
   - Fiscal Discipline
   - Tax reforms
   - Financial Liberalization 
   - Trade Liberalization

>Neera Chandoke summaries'
>The state both in north and the 3rd world country should withdraw from the social sector. 
>The market should be access to all spheres of life and social reproduction and thus be free from all constraints. 
>People should organize their own socio economic reproduction instead of depending of state. 

3. Post Washington Consensus(1990s-present)
   - In third phase major world economic and non-economic institution are discussing the problem of governance. 
   - State mechanism should be more focused on delivering prescribed services rather than socio economic sphere of life. 

##### State
- State should be minimal state and must be limited to function of providng security against force theft fraud at the same time enforcement of contract.  
- State must be there to promote the interest of everyone mainly in economic terms. 
- Neo-Liberals support workfare state against welfare state. 
>As per neo-liberals idea behind workfarism is poverty , unemployment doesn't occur because there are few jobs but because unemployed people are ill suited to jobs or who do not have economic ideas vibarant. 
>Liverterian state has to provide all such activites which leads to consolidation of individual rights establishing free arkets and establish peace. 
>Concep of Robert Nozick is considered to be best explaination of neo-liberal state
>> 1. All individual have inalienable rights independent to society. They are not dependent over the state or society for poseesing of the individual rights. 
>> 2. Function of state is to ensure there should not be violation of this inalienable right of individual. Nozcik believe in "Nightwatchman state"
>> 3. Liberty must get priorty over equality. Function of state must be limited only to ensuring exercise of liberty.  
>> 4. He categoricaly instructed state not to go for [[Progressive Tax|Progressive Tax]] , Public Healthcare. State intervention means both ones resources and ones self. Seizing the result of someones labour is equivalent to seizing hours from him and directing various activities thus welfare state is threat to liberty and independence of individual. 
>> 5. [[The minimal state is inspiring as well as right|The minimal state is inspiring as well as right]]. What is importonat is that state must not use cohersive appartus for pourpose of getting some citizens other and prohibit activity of other for their own good and protection. 


> Hayek's View 
> 1. His view support neo-liberalism
> 2. Liberty or freedom of a person is non cohersion and he must not be subject of arbitrary will of another person. 
> 3. Liberty must not be confused with any other meaning of freedom.
> 4. Absence or presence of a freedom can not be suffiicient condition of liberty. Liberty is bigger condition which enable a person to act as per his will without being under arbitrary will of either state or individual. 
> 5. State might emerge as a threat to liberty in this way freedom from constraints of state is condition of liberty. 
> 6. In order to proote liberty state should be confined to minimal work and to promote free competition and must not take cohersive measure. 
> 7. Hayek further argued that equality is essentialy
