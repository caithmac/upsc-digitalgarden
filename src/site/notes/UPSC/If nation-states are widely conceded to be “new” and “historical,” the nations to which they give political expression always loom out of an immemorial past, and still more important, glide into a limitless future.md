Topic:: If nation-states are widely conceded to be “new” and “historical,” the nations to which they give political expression always loom out of an immemorial past, and still more important, glide into a limitless future.

>The idea of nation state is generally considered to be relatively new and historical phenomena. The concept of the nation state has its root in Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. However, the nations that are represented by nation-state often have deep roots in the past and a potential for a long-lasting history and potentially indefinite future.

The Indian nationalist perspective also had various different views. They all argued what was India, what was its past what will be its future. 

Colonials saw India as merely a geographical expression much like Africa or Europe. They thought it was impossible to forge a nation in India, because it never had and never will the characteristics of nation.  


They accepted colonial argument and didn't contest British on India was not nation, rather they put forward a simple word, yet. India was not yet a nation. 
Liberals argued that India is nation in making. They agreed that India was old civilization but a new nation.  Tara Chand argued that the creation of an Indian nation was a recent phenomena which emerged due to combined economic and political change. 

Some cultural nationalist painted India of being the cultural and civilizational nation since millennia. Aurobindo Ghosh held that - India was always a nation. Nation has spirit and spirit never dies. 
J P Jayswal argued that - India possessed everything which modern British could claim - big empires, enduring and successful republic. representative elective institution etc. Hence, it was always a nation. 
So they were adamant that the conception of nation-state could be new for India, but India that is Bharat has been in existence since eternity and will remain so for foreseeable future. 

>[!tip] Conclusion
> India has a history that stretches back thousands of years and includes a rich cultural heritage. The Indian independence movement, which began in 19th century and continued till mid-20th century was driven in large part by a desire to establish a sovereign, independent nation for the Indian people. This movement ultimately succeeded in 1947, when India gained its independence from British rule and became a sovereign nation-state.
