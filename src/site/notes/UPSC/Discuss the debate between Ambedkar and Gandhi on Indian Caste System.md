> [!done] Body

Both leaders addressed this issue but with different approaches and sometimes contradicting each other. 
- Ambedkar wanted to end caste system as as not only this was the reason behind the plight of untouchables but also because this was given divine sanctions. 
- Gandhi on the other hand wanted to reform the caste system not only through abolition of untouchability but also giving equal status to each occupation. 
- Ambedkar was convinced that the condition of untouchable could be fixed only through winning political rights. For it he argued for separate electorate for untouchable. And in this regard [[UPSC/Communal Award\|Communal Award]] was provided. 
- Gandhi began his epic fast against communal award. And outpouring support came for him. Ambedkar had to relent. Gandhi promised Ambedkar in Poona Pact of reserved seats to depressed class. 
- Gandhi also initiated a series of programs and campaign for the promotion of interest of untouchable. He stated that untouchability was crime against both humanity and God. 
- Involvement of Gandhi actually weakened the position of Ambedkar. He couldn't politicize the untouchables. 
- Gandhi basic difference was on Ambedkar aspect of doing away Chaturvarna.  
- While Ambedkar was frustrated with slow pace in Gandhi's efforts.
