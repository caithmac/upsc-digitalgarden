## Two Treatise on Civil Government.
- First Treaty critiqued Robert Filmer's "Divine Theory of King" written in book Patriarcha 
- Filmer supported political and religious doctrine of royal and political legitimacy
	- As it says King or Monarch is not subject to any earthly authority because it derives its power the will of god. 
	- King can not be judged or ordered either by people or aristocracy but only by God. 
	- People don't have any right to protest or resist and only god can judge an unjust king. 
	- Protest against kings is protest against god and it creates a disrespectful act. 
- Filmer rejected idea of social contract and argued that man is not born outside or before a state or society. This social contract is illogical even if people enter into contract but next generation is not part of it.
- Lock argues that there is no evidence that the God has given any authority to any King or authority. 
- Even if we agree God did that, then there is a conclusive prove that God has allowed Adam to pass the authority to his son or successor. 
- There is a problem in identifying who are the real successor. 
- Locke finally says so much time has passed since supposedly God gave authority to Adam, that the event itself has lost relevance and we need a new contract to establish new rules of authority 

- Locke in his **second treaty of civil Government** explained that 
>"Man being by nature is all free, equal and independent, no one can be put out of this state, and subjected to political power of an other, without his own consent." 

He further explained state of nature. Human nature is good helpful, people live in harmony and help each other. Optimistic view of human nature. Human being is self centered but also has reason. *Human being is worried about his own interest but at the same time he takes care of other as well.* State of nature is condition is state of peace, goodwill, mutual assistance and preservation. Locke identified 3 natural right, life, liberty and natural right. He identified laws of nature as inner morality that determine behavior of people. Reason is the core of law of nature. *Men are rational and everyone treats other as they would treat themselves.*

- As per Locke state of nature proved to be inconvenient. Locke identified two major inconvenience.
	- Common authority to interpret law, at the same time implement those law. There was always threat that everyone can become judge of its own case that is violation of natural justice. 
	- Locke was who created idea of [[UPSC/Constitutionalism\|Constitutionalism]], limited government and political sovereignty and representative government 
	- [[Locke is an individualist\|Locke is an individualist]]

	- Based on consent 
	- State is limited (Minimal state)
	- Liberal- Democratic state 
	- Tolerant state 
	- Constitution based on rule of law.
	- Negative state - it is only for security, peace and law and order. 
	- Having created political society and government thrugh consent, men gained three things which they lacked in state of nature.
		- Positive Law - which law has been codified by parliament 
		- Judges to adjudicate laws 
		- Executive power neceassry to enforce these laws. 
	- According to Locke the purpose of government of law is to uphold and protect the natural right of man, so long the government fulfils this pourpose, the laws given by it are valid and binding but when it ceases to fulfil it then the laws would have no validity and the government could be thrown out. 
	- John Locke advocated 'state of liberty;not of licenses'
	- He further pleads for constitutional and limited government as a summary these are features of Lockean state:
		- Welfare is the ultimate target.
		- Based on consent. 
		- State is based on law. Where law ends, tyranny begins. 
		- State is limited not absolute - state is agent of masses and came into being for serve purpose of masses. 
		- State is negative state because state is only for security, peace and justice related work, not for welfare 
		- Tolerant and Liberal state. Following Life Liberty and Property. 
	- According to Locke there are three major organs of state 
		- Legislative : Codification of Law
		- Executive : Implementation of Law as well adjucation. 
		- Fedrative : Related to treaty with other state. 

- ##### Property Rights. 
	- Industrial Revolution, because of it there would be profit, wealth, as we know in feudal society , property is considered belong to God-King-Feudal lords.
	- Common man cant have property. 
		- Scientist

##### Theory of Natural Rights 
- According to Locke human being has three basic natural right
	- Right to Life 
	- Right to Liberty 
	- Right to Property 
- These laws are derived from nature as human being is natural entity so go certain rights. These natural rights are limited only by natural law. 
- The freedom of man and liberty and acting according to his will is grounded on his reason, which is able to instruct him to govern himself. 

##### Concept of Property 
- According to Locke right to property is most important and crucial right, social contract has been done to save this property and even state can not impose any limitation without the consent of owner of property. [[UPSC/Right to property\|Right to property]] is intimately connected with right to life and liberty as it is necessary consequence. Sometimes Locke sums up all natural right in the right to property. Man creates property by mixing his labor with the object of his nature. In the beginning objects of nature all the things were held in common but common ownership is not enough to satisfy their need. Man must mix his labor with his resources provided by nature to enable him to make use of them in a more effective and profitable way.  Since man owns his own personality, his body and limbs, mind, the object with which he mixes his labor becomes his own property by right. 
- Labor theory of Value / Labour Mix Theory 
- Possessive Individualism 
- According to Locke labor not only creates property but it also determines value of property. He said that 90% value of property must be determined on basis of labor. Locke puts three limitation over property. 
	1. Labor limitation 
	2. Utility-sufficiency limitation 
	3. Spoilage 
- All things were held in common, all natural resources were available equally to everyone. 
- But common ownership is not sufficient to provide men with desired life and satisfaction of their life. 
- Locke identified 3 principle related with property.
	- Labour Principle - Man must mix his or her labour with resources to claim it. Labour purely belongs to him, so mixing it creates property. (Labour theory of Value)
		- According to Locke, labour not only creates but it also determines value of property. He said 90% of value of property must be determine on principle labour. 
		- Locke put certain limitation on property 
		- Its utility according to needs; one should not be allowed to accumulate property to destroy, property should not be left to rotten. Can not be acquired through force. 
	- Principle of Sufficiency 
		- As per Locke man has complete right to appropriate as much as required by him and leave enough and as good for other
	- Spoilage 
		- Man should require property only if he can make good use of it. 
		- Since nothing was made by God for man to destroy. If one takes more, he invades his neighbors share.
- Locke doesn't believes that man has unlimited right of appropriation. 
###### Criticism 
- Many critics have found these right to be verbal and in favor of accumulation of unlimited property . Macpherson criticized Locke by arguing that -
	-  Locke made labor a commodity to purchase and sell and made it rightful for a man to appropriate the product of other men labor. 
	- Introduction of currency which allows man to exchange goods for money, removes the limitation imposed by non spoilage principle 
	- Locke not only justifies unequal property but approves of unlimited individual appropriation. 
	- This theory is indication of departure from medieval view of property and acceptance of Bourgeoise view. Justifies unequal property and individual appropriation. 
	- Macpherson concludes that Locke is presented as an ideologue of Possessive Individualism of market economy and dictatorship of bourgeoisie. "He is seen as typical representation spirit of capitalism". 
- John Plamentz critic
	- Locke as pro-capitalist and anti-people. He further said that limitation imposed by Locke are either irrelevant or inadequate. 
- [[UPSC/I Berlin\|I Berlin]] , Alan Ryan, Richard Ascraft, John Dun
	- Supported Locke's view. And argued that Macpherson's view overlooks the overriding role of natural law and idea of common good that it implies. 
	- John Plamentaz > Locke was the first of the liberal of our era. 
- John Dunning
	- Most distinctive contribution of Locke to political theory is the theory of natural right  

##### Revolution 
- Locke supports right of revolution of the people 
- Why? 
	- People are endowed with reason, conscience, morality and knowledge of right and wrong.  
	- Government has been created by themselves completely based on consent so people have superior logic or reasoning against the state if it is violating rights of the people. 
	- He supports change of govt has to be peaceful as man is rational. 
- ###### Causes of revolution 
	- When govt doesnt act as per wishes of people 
	- when executive doesnt allow legislature to function 
	- When executive doesnt rule according to legislature 
	- when govt puts people under foreign rule 
	- The end of law is not to abolish or restraint but to preserve and enlarge freedom. As per Locke citizens are householders who employ night watchamn to gaurd the house and the citizens remain vigilant to watchman that the
