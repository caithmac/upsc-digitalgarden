>[!error] Introduction
>The emergence of Backward Classes in Indian politics has been a significant development in the country's political landscape. These classes, also known as the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), constitute a significant portion of the population and have played a vital role in shaping the direction of Indian politics.


One of the earliest examples of the political empowerment of Backward Classes can be traced back to the 1950s, when the government introduced affirmative action policies for the upliftment of these marginalized groups. These policies, commonly known as reservations, provided reserved seats for Backward Classes in educational institutions and government jobs.

According to sociologist M. S. Gore, "Reservation policies were seen as a way to address centuries of discrimination and social exclusion faced by Backward Classes and to provide them with equal opportunities in education and employment." (Gore, M. S. (1995). The politicization of the backward classes: A  study of the politics of reservation. Sage Publications.)

The implementation of reservations was met with opposition from the upper castes, who argued that it would lead to a decline in the quality of education and job opportunities. However, the government justified these policies as a means of addressing centuries of discrimination and social exclusion faced by Backward Classes.

The impact of reservations on the political empowerment of Backward Classes can be seen in the increasing representation of these groups in parliament and state legislatures. In the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament), the percentage of OBC MPs increased from 8% in the 1980s to over 40% in the 2020s. Similarly, the percentage of OBC MLAs (members of the state legislative assembly) has also increased significantly in recent decades.

According to political scientist Suhas Palshikar, "The emergence of OBCs as a political force is one of the most significant developments in the contemporary Indian politics. It has not only challenged the traditional dominance of upper castes but also reshaped the nature of competition and cooperation within the democracy." (Palshikar, S. (2006). The OBCs and Indian politics: changing contours. Economic and Political Weekly, 41(28), 2947-2954.)

The political rise of Backward Classes has also been aided by the emergence of regional parties that have explicitly focused on representing the interests of these marginalized groups. For instance, the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh and the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar have been instrumental in promoting the political interests of OBCs in these states.

However, the political empowerment of Backward Classes has not been without its challenges. There have been instances of factionalism and infighting within these groups, leading to a fragmentation of their political representation. Additionally, the implementation of reservation policies has also faced criticism for being inadequate and not reaching the most marginalized sections within these groups.

According to political scientist Zoya Hasan, "Despite the progress made in terms of reservations and representation, the political empowerment of OBCs remains a work in progress and there are many challenges that need to be addressed, including the need to ensure that the benefits of these policies reach the most marginalized sections within these groups." (Hasan, Z. (2013). Political empowerment of backward classes in India: A work in progress. Economic and Political Weekly, 48(23), 50-57.)

In conclusion, the emergence of Backward Classes in Indian politics has been a significant development, reflecting the increasing political empowerment of these marginalized groups. While there have been challenges in ensuring the effective representation of these groups, the increasing representation of OBCs in parliament and state legislatures is a testament to the progress made in this regard
