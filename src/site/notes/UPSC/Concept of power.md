- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Force is different from power</mark>, it is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">most brutal manifestation of power</mark>. 
- The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">technique in force</mark> involved are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">threat</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">restraint</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">intimidation</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">blackmail</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">terrorism</mark> and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> military force</mark>.

## Implication of Power
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Power can not be encircled only in political or economical sphere, it is broadly social phenomena.</mark> <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Power is a latent force, force is manifested power and authority is instinulised power</mark>. 
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Power appears in different ways in different occasion be it a formal organization or in an informal organization. Or in organized or unorganized community</mark>.

### Different Power Theory 
- ##### Liberal Democratic Theory
	- Power has been identified with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">developmental</mark> and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extractive capacity</mark>. In other words, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">power means ability and use  and development of human capacities</mark>. 
	- It has two aspects- 
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extractive or ethical</mark>
			- Man should use his capacity in a way so that he may extract benefits from other. It leads to power of extractive power. 
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">development, or empirical</mark> dimension respectively. 
			- Since a mans ability to use and develop his capacity becomes the power, it is called mans development power.
	
- ##### Marxian Theory 
	- Links politics and economics through instrument of power. 
	- [[UPSC/Karl Marx|Karl Marx]] viewed political power as being possessed those who control means of production. The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">relation of production therefore determines distribution of political power</mark>. 
	- Thus, [[UPSC/Karl Marx|Karl Marx]] sees a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">close integration between political power and prevailing socio-economic system</mark> and regards it as transient - <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">it shall disappear with rise of stateless and classless society</mark>. 

### Dimension of Power 
- Power has two specific dimension 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Transitive</mark>
		- Consist of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">subordination of ones will by will of another</mark>.
		-  In this sense <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">power is not possible without counter power</mark>, both in symmetrical relationship. 
		- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Max Webber</mark>'̥s formulation reflects transitive power. 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Intransitive </mark>
		- It is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">not zero sum game</mark> but has positive pay off. 
		- It refers to the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">subordination one persons will to the will of another, within a community</mark>. It takes into account, the communality that exist within members of community.  
- Along with this 
	- economic power 
	- ideological power or 
	- other set of power. 
- Idea of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">David Held</mark>,̥ 
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Eric R Wolf</mark> ̥distinguishes between four modality of power. 
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Michael Mann</mark>;̥ there are two expression of state power, 
	- despotic and 
	- infrastructural..
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Galbrith</mark> ̥distinguishes three 


##### What is authority? 
- Authority refers to person, group of person <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">who holds ability of use of legitimate power.</mark>
-  <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Max Webber</mark> ̥suggested 3 fold classification that exist in modern state. 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Legal Rational Authority</mark> - 
		-  <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Is explicit and right to give order and have them obeyed by virtue of an office held within a system of deliberately framed rules which set out rights and duty</mark>. 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Traditional</mark> -
		-  exist where a person, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">such as tribal chief or religious leader hold superior position of command</mark> in accordance with long tradition and is obeyed <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">because everyone accepts scanty of tradition</mark>. 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Charismatic</mark> -
		-  It rest on <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">position of exceptional personal quality</mark> that cause a person to be accepted as leader. This might be <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">intellect ortar skills, quality of outstanding heroism</mark>. 
- The concept of power and authority is related but they are different too, 
- Both the term <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">refer to different properties and logically connected which makes it difficult to differentiate</mark>. 
- Authority is a type of authorization of use of legitimate power. 
- Authority is essentially associated with positive outcome in case of power it is not necessary. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Professor Raphal</mark>,̥ in his book "<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Problems of political philosophy</mark>"̥ defined power in terms 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Ability </mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Power in social context</mark> 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Coercive power. </mark>
- Authority correspond to all three power when legitimacy is associated with it. 

##### [[Legitimacy|Legitimacy]]
- Legitimacy is defined around the idea of exercise of power in any act. 
- In political science, legitimacy is essentially associated with right and acceptance of authority. 
- Legitimacy is value whereby something or someone is recognized as right and proper. 
- Legitimacy leads to acceptance and recognition/.
- In general there are two theory of legitimacy. 
- ##### Liberal Theory 
	- The ideal of impartiality is clearly a part of it. This theory accepts that people follow order of government as the laws are impartial and rational. Th
	- This theory was criticized by Joseph Raz and he supported discourse theory of legitimacy. 
- ##### Deliberative theory 
	- Attempts to overcome liberal ideal of impartiality by modifying the concept of rationality. 
	- The discourse theory contends that rationality can not be a possession of separate autonomous individual rather a shared achievement possible within the framework of free and rational public. 
	- Habermas is considered to be supporter of this theory the key to legitimacy is "non instrumental" ideal of non-communicative rationality. 
	- This can only achieved in what he call ideal speech situation.

##### Legitimacy Crisis
>[!error] Introduction 


- Habbermass has developed an alternative to webberian approach to legitamacy. 
- Habbermass didn't adopt orthodox marxist position which saw legitimacy as nothing more than burgoise myth. 
- Habbermass admited that modern capitalist society or liberal democracy have a system of drying out of consent and support of the people. Democratic system, party system, social and welfare reforms are mechanism to maintain consent and legitamacy. 
- In his work "Legitamacy Crisis 1973", he identified arising crisis tendency within capitalist society. These crisis tendency emerged as a result of fundamnetal contradiction between the logic of capitalist accumulation and popular pressure of welfarism unleashed by democratic politics. 
- In modern capitalist society legitamacy is secured by democratic process, which lead to further demarcts for social welfare provision. Increased poupular participationn and social equality. 
- This inturn puts pressure on the state to expands its social responsibility and state intervention for removing inequality. Such demands and activities leads to increased expenditure on welfare. 
- It leads to increase in taxation and public spending and restrict capitalist accumulatiuon by restricting profit level and discouraging interpricess. 
-  Thus a capitalist society is constantly in the grip of crisis tendency that is legitamacy. 
- According to habbermass capitalist democracy can not satisfy both for popular demands for social equality welfare right and requirement of a market economy based on private proft. The implication of such crisis involves a disturbance  of integration or cohesion of society and regulatory structure of capitalist system

>[!hint] Conclusion

###### State Action 
- In such scenario of crisis, modern state uses resources for system steering and ideologiocal measure to legitamise and stablise the existing structure. 
- State not only try to dissociate political and economic sphere but at the same time promote non intervrntion in economy is the best way of development. (Margret Thatcher's Roll back of state)
- With above measure state gets success in establishing that the exploitative relationship between wage labour and capitalist is no longer part of political spehre. Politioal sphere becomes less personal and highly beuracrised.
