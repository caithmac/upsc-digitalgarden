##### Parliamentary or Presidential - What should India choose? Why? 
###### Reason for Parliamentary? 
- Familiarity 
- More democratic
- Power is not centralized in one person; there is a cabinet or CoM 
- More accountable on day to day basis. (Why)
- More representative; more suitable for India's diversity(USA too diverse still using Presidential)
###### Why demand for Presidential system in India? 
- India had faced coalition government in an era of unhealthy coalition culture
- Problems
	- Instability 
	- Policy Paralysis 
	- Corruption 
	- [[UPSC/defection|defection]]/Horse Trading 
###### Should there be change? 
1. The reasons which were in mind of constituent assembly, at the time formation of constitution are still relevant. 
2.  Institution won't make difference unless political culture changes, as suggested by Ambedkar ,"The constitution will work or not, will depend upon the person holding the institutions." 
   > "The constitution will work or not, will depend upon the person holding the institution. "
   
3. Presidential system has it own challenge, problem of gridlock. 
4. USA is the only country in world where the democratic feature of presidential system could be retained. In all other countries -> Dictatorship.  

##### Conclude. 
Institution won't make difference until and unless the person holding these institution do not to change.  The main reason of dissatisfaction with parliamentary system is defection, corruption, hence we can experiment with following system. 
1. Introduction of the system of constructive vote of non confidence as in Germany. 
2. Tighten the [[Anti defection|Anti defection]] law.
