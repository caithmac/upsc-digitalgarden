For Aristotle monarchy resemble the [[Philosopher King|Philosopher King]], but it is not feasible. Monarchy transcend into Tyranny, therefore next best for him is Polity. 
Why is Polity is best? 
- Polity neigther rule of poor nor rich but middle class 
- While Democracy is rule of poor which will eventually replace into tyranny and the rich will be always against it. 
- Aristocracy will eventually become oligarchy or will be thrown by poor. 
- Polity instead represents golden mean between oligarchy and democracy.
- While the rich and poor don't trust each other they will be accomodating to the rule of middle class. 
- For Aristotle Polity is best form of government since it is best practicable form and prefarable to both democracy and aristocracy since the poor suffers from ignorance and rich from arrogance.
