India's adoption of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) as a foreign policy stance during the Cold War was a strategic move to maintain its autonomy in the face of increasing global polarization.

The origins of NAM can be traced back to the Bandung Conference of 1955, where leaders of Asian and African countries gathered to discuss issues of decolonization and the impact of the Cold War on their countries. India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, was a key participant in this conference and was among the countries that pushed for the formation of NAM.

One of the main reasons for India's adoption of NAM was its desire to maintain its independence and avoid being aligned with either the Western or Eastern blocs. As a newly independent nation, India did not want to be seen as taking sides in the Cold War, as this would have limited its ability to maintain friendly relations with both sides. Additionally, India's policy of non-alignment allowed it to maintain good relations with both the United States and the Soviet Union, which were important trading partners at the time.

Another reason for India's adoption of NAM was its desire to promote decolonization and support for the countries of the Third World. India, as a former colony itself, was deeply committed to the cause of decolonization and saw NAM as a way to promote this goal on a global scale.

In conclusion, India's adoption of NAM as a foreign policy stance during the Cold War was a strategic move to maintain its autonomy and independence in the face of increasing global polarization. It allowed India to maintain friendly relations with both sides, promote decolonization and support for the countries of the Third World. India's non-alignment policy also paved the way for its recent 5 pillar diplomacy which aims to focus on its neighbourhood first, act east and think west and be a force for global good.
