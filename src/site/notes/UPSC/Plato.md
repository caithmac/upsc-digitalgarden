----
> [!Error] Short Note

##### Reality is shadow of Idea / Ideal is real
- Plato identified idea as ultimate truth or true reality . 
- Further explained that what we sense or know through sensory organ is just reflection of ideas or true reality, it is not real. 
- Idea is essence of everything which remain constant, permanent and never gets destroyed. Thus it is true reality. 
- The physical world which we experience is a temporary image of idea, physical manifestation of idea are true thing. There is difference b/w knowing and knowledge. In physical world we know, we organize facts and information not knowledge. 
- Plato expressed his philosophy by [[UPSC/Allegory of the Cave|Allegory of the Cave]]; in this example people mistakenly understand shadow as reality. Similar phenomena which happens in real life. 
- This understanding that physical world is temporary and realm of ideas is permanent is crucial for ruling class. 
- Rulers must understand that power, wealth, glory are temporary. 
- **Virtue and integrity are permanent**
