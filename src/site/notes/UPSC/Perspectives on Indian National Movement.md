# Perspectives on Indian National Movement

## Colonial Perspective 
- According to [[John Strachey|John Strachey]]  there was never a nation called India. There is no "indian nation" , no "people of India" 
	- It had no political, physical social or religious unity according to European ideas. 
- [[John Seeley|John Seeley]] expressed that India is merely a geographical expression much like Africa or Europe. It marks territories of many language and many nation. 
- [[John Strachey|John Strachey]] and [[John Seeley|John Seeley]] both asserted that it was impossible to forge a nation in India, because it never had a the characteristics of nation nor it will have in future. 
- With the rise of [[UPSC/Indian Nationalism|Indian Nationalism]] movement, it became very important for colonial ideologues and historian to counter Nationalists position of existence of an Indian Nation. 
- [[Valentine Chirol|Valentine Chirol]] in Indian Unrest (1910) - wrote - India is a mere geographical expression, and even this expression was forged by British. 
	- India is the "antithesis" of the word nation, 
	- As India was inhabited by " great variety of nation" and was essentially 'variegated jumble of races and people, castes and creeds'
	- And British administration was handling all the administration in a way as to prevent these ancient divisions from breaking out once more into open and sanguinary strife. 

## Nationalist Perspective 
### Liberal
- They didn't attempt to go to extreme opposite of Colonial Perspective of 'Never a nation' with 'always a nation'
- They accepted Colonial arguments and didn't contest British on  'India was not nation'. Rather put forward a simple word, "yet", India was not yet a nation. 
- Hence as S N Banerjee said, "India is nation in making", which was the title of his autobiography too. 
- India was old civilization and new nation. 
- Liberals had a Whig view of history as per [[Bipin Chandra|Bipin Chandra]] and see nationalism as result of the spread of the ideas or spirit of nationalization. 
- Liberals considered that the task of nationalism was to unite India from various regions and different walks of life into a single nation based on their common grievances. 
- [[R C Majumdar|R C Majumdar]] argued that the 'conception of India as a common motherland was still in the realm of fancy'
- He thought movement started by [[UPSC/Indian National Congress|Indian National Congress]] gave reality to ideal Indian unity. 
- [[Tara Chand|Tara Chand]] also thought that the creation of an Indian nation was a recent phenomenon which emerged due to combined economic and political change 


### Cultural Nationalism
- [[UPSC/Cultural Nationalism|Cultural Nationalism]]
- [[Radha Kumud Mookerji|Radha Kumud Mookerji]] - India had been great and unified since ancient times. There had existed sense of geographical unity of India. 
- H B Sarda -   "The ancient Hindus were the great nation that has yet flourished in the Earth"
- J P Jayswal - "India possessed everything which modern British could claim - big empires, enduring and successful republic, representative elective institution etc"
- - [[Aurobindo Ghosh|Aurobindo Ghosh]] - Held that India was always a nation. Nation has a spirit and spirit never dies. 


### Marxist 
- Based on the analysis of modes of production and class
- There was basic contradiction between imperialism and Indian society 
- They try to explain these with reference to the economic changes under colonialism 
- They also believe that India was not a nation but rather was nation that was being created in modern time and nationalist movement had a major role to play.

- [[UPSC/M.N. Roy|M.N. Roy]] in his book; *India in Transition* , argued that the nationalist movement had developed at a certain juncture in the development of international capitalism 
	- That India was  moving toward capitalism and had already come within the ambit of global capitalism. 
	- The dominant class in India were not feudal class but bourgeoise. 
	- He believed that it was the political of native capitalism which developed in the late 19th and early 20th century in the shadow of imperialism.

- [[R P Dutt|R P Dutt]] - most influential Marxist interpretation of Indian Nationalism in his book *India Today*
	- [[UPSC/Revolution of 1857|Revolution of 1857]] "was in its essential character and dominant leadership the revolt of the old conservative and feudal forces dethroned potentates"
	- He believed that [[UPSC/Indian National Congress|Indian National Congress]] came into existence through the initiative and under the guidance of direct British government policy, on a plan secretly pre-arranged with the Viceroy as an intended weapon for safeguarding British rule against the rising forces of popular unrest and anti-British feeling. 
	- But later on [[UPSC/Indian National Congress|Indian National Congress]] had to give in to popular nationalist feeling and had to abandoned its loyalist character and adopted a national role. 
	- In the initial years - "only big bourgeoise" were represented by Indian Nationalism. 
	- After World War - urban petty bourgeois class became more influential. 
	- Leadership though remained in the hands of the "propertied class"
		- These element prevented radicalization of the national movement. 
	- [[Gandhi|Gandhi]] was "the mascot of the bourgeoisie" according to [[R P Dutt|R P Dutt]]
	- He argued that [[UPSC/Non Cooperation Movement|Non Cooperation Movement]] was withdrawn because it threatened propertied class. 
	- His work was a trendsetter in the Marxist perspective of National Movement. 

- [[A R Desai|A R Desai]] Social Background of Indian Nationalism (1948) : He categorizes national development in five phases. 
	1. First Phase; Initiated by intelligentsia, product of modern system of education, [[Raja Rammohan Roy|Raja Rammohan Roy]] 
	2. Second Phase; Formation of [[UPSC/Indian National Congress|Indian National Congress]] till 1905l it represented the interest of new bourgeoisie.

- Bipin Chandra - Nationalist movement as represented by the [[UPSC/Indian National Congress|Indian National Congress]] was "a bourgeois democratic movement, that is, it represented the interest of all classes and segment of Indian Society vis-a-vis imperialism but under the hegemony of the industrial bourgeoisie. 
	- Bipin Chandra in his later work has shifted his view and now considered working of  [[UPSC/Indian National Congress|Indian National Congress]] as   [[UPSC/Gramsci|Gramsci]] 's war of Position whereby prolonged struggle is waged for the attainment of goal. 
	- **The struggle was not violent because th enationalist leaders were concerned with fighting against imperalism as well as welding India into a nation.** 
	- The national movement was now conceived as an all class movement which provided space and opportunity for any class to build hegemony. 
	- Moreover now [[UPSC/Indian National Congress|Indian National Congress]] is considered not as a party but as movement.
