Topic: Reality is shadow of Idea/Idea is real
Date: 2022-06-18
Course:: [[UPSC/PSIR|PSIR]] 

----
> [!Error] Short Note
> ##### Reality is shadow of Idea / Ideal is real
> - Plato identified idea as ultimate truth or true reality . 
> -  Further explained that what we sense or know through sensory organ is just reflection of ideas or true reality, it is not real. 
> - Idea is essence of everything which remain constant, permanent and never gets destroyed. Thus it is true reality. 
> - The physical world which we experience is a temporary image of idea, physical manifestation of idea are true thing. There is difference b/w knowing and knowledge. In physical world we know, we organize facts and information not knowledge. 
> - Plato expressed his philosophy by [[UPSC/Allegory of the Cave|Allegory of the Cave]]; in this example people mistakenly understand shadow as reality. Similar phenomena which happens in real life. 
> - This understanding that physical world is temporary and realm of ideas is permanent is crucial for ruling class. 
> - Rulers must understand that power, wealth, glory are temporary. 
> - **Virtue and integrity are permanent**

Topic:: Evolution of Plato's Education System
Date:: 2022-06-24
Course:: [[UPSC/PSIR|PSIR]] 

----
##### Evolution of Plato's Education System
- Equality of opportunity -> Men and Women get to harness their capability 
- Education System is of all round development 
- Theoretical as well as practical 

###### Criticism 
- Stresses more on administration and rulers
- More opportunity available to two classes
- Aims to produce ideal philosopher not man of action 
- More emphasis on Maths/Philosophy not on literature 
- Timer period of 35 years- Expensive and Hazardous
- After passing through such long process it will be difficult for the guardians to maintain efficiency as desired by Plato 
- as outcome of education all men/women do not posses equal  capacity for virtue therefore all are not entitle to participate in function of government on  basis of equality.

Topic:: Plato's Feminism
Date:: 2022-06-24
Course:: [[UPSC/PSIR|PSIR]]

# Plato's Feminism
#### Argument: 

##### First feminist 
- Men and Women were allowed to be in any class. 
- Made mandotry for women's consent. 
- In his [[UPSC/Theory of Education|Theory of Education]] all kids are allowed to take state sponsored education. 
- Greek was stratified; women condition was poor, he didn't make any special reference to women; hence treating them same as everybody. 

##### Not feminist; accidental feminist. 
- He failed to mention women. 
- Generally meant men. 
- Accidently left women. 
-  ***I thank God that I was born Greek and not barbarian, freeman and not slave, man and not woman; but above all, that I was born in the age of Socrates***
- Hard to believe that he made such big mistake; Women condition was bad. (Opposition of above argument)
