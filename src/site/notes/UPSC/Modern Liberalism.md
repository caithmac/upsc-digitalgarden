###### Justification for Welfare State
- Man is a part of social whole and liberty could be secured only so long as they could be reconciled with social good. 
- Liberty of a person should be compromised for social good. Led to emergence of [[UPSC/Positive Liberty\|Positive Liberty]](restrictive liberty in favor of social good)
- Societies are considered potentially harmonious and ordered structure in which all social classes work for the common good. There is a societal good apart from thus individual good can not be achieved without social good.. Led to emergence of compromising individual liberty in favor of society which extended role of state. 
- Liberty in the society implied adjustment of mutual claims that are made possible through a system of rights. In order to adjust mutual claims state has to play a positive role by restriction and extension on liberty. 
- Liberty was not merely absence of restraint but condition necessary for free and full development of self(self development holds a purpose). State helped to achieve that purpose with restriction and extension of liberty. 
- Equality provided the basis through which liberty comes to acquire a positive meaning. Liberty and equality are complimentary not contradictory. 
- The state is an instrument for the development of human personality for welfare measures. The state has positive character and is capable of performing socially useful function.
