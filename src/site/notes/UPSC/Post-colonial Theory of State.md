### Core Idea of their Argument 
- The west sees the non-west through a lenses which is a highly clouded by the legacies of European colonialism and imperialism 
- It discusses mainly how the legacy of colonialism has made an image of the non-westerner as 'other' than the west, and most often than not - as inferior 
- By doing so Europe has justified the colonialization and imperialism in the garb of bringing civilization or progress to non west people. 

### Feature of Post-Colonialism 

### Views on Modernity and Globalisation
- Rise of post-colonialism is also related to the process of western reflection on modernity.. 
- History shows that modernity in the whole world is phenomenon that occurs in collusion with colonization. 
- Western countries use an unbalanced power to force people of other areas to conform to western standards of modernity whether or not it express their reality. 
- Reflection of Modernity lead to reflection on globalization. 
- The age of post-colonialism is simply the age of of globalization. 
- As Giddens says, globalization is the extension of modernity in the whole world. 
- Western bourgeois tries to create a world according to their own perceptions, tries to subjugate the uncivilized and semi-civilized countries,.
- The process of globalization itself creates imperialism. 
- If globalization is unavoidable, it will be realized by way of colonialism. 
- Post colonialism reflects globalization from the point of view of colonization and discusses the cultural relations between the East and the West from the perspective of globalization- the orientalisation and cultural hegemony of the west to the east 


> Homi Bhabha, in his book "The Location of Culture", argues that the modern state is a site of cultural hybridity, in which the legacies of colonialism and imperialism are mixed and intertwined with the cultures of the colonized and the colonizer. Bhabha argues that this hybridity creates a space for resistance and subversion, as the legacies of colonialism are transformed and challenged through the encounter with the cultures of the colonized.
