Welfare state can be justified on the following grounds. 
- Welfare state believes that man is part of social whole and liberty could be only secured when they could be reconciled with total good. 
- Liberty is not merely absence of restraint but condition necessary for free  and full development of self. Ensuring this is true moral purpose of the state. [[UPSC/John S. Mill|John S. Mill]] justified social and welfare legislation on these ground only. In a marked departure from classical liberal state, Welfare State believes that liberty and equality are complementary not contradictory. 
- WS believes in regulated capitalist economy in favor of society. 
- Unlike the nightwatchman state it has positive character and performs socially useful function. 
- The welfare state was characterized by continued features [[UPSC/Democracy|democracy]], represented government, [[UPSC/Constitutionalism|constitutionalism]], deliberative legislation and universal franchise.
- The welfare state doesn't belong to a particular class but to the whole society.
