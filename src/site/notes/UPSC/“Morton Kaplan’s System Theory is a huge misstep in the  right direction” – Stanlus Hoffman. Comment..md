In the field of international relations, Morton Kaplan proposed a systems approach with the goal of providing a grand theory of international politics that could explain the past, present and future of international relations.

Kaplan proposed different models, such as the balance of power model, bipolar model, and universal actor model, with the intention of providing a theoretical framework for understanding the international political landscape.

However, this systems approach has been met with criticism from scholars like Stanley Hoffman. One major criticism is that Kaplan's models do not capture the complexities and nuances of real-world international politics. For example, some models are hypothetical and do not reflect current international politics, while others are outdated and do not take into account changes in the international political landscape.

Additionally, Kaplan's models have been criticized for lacking analytical or explanatory importance. They fail to explain the environment, structures, functions, input-output processes and the role of domestic variables in international politics.

Furthermore, Kaplan's models have been criticized for not fulfilling even the basic requirements of systems theory. They do not explain the environment, structures, functions, input-output processes and the role of domestic variables in international politics.

Another criticism is that the ultimate goal of the discipline of international politics is to find ways to establish peace and Kaplan's models do not have any relevance in that regard.

Despite these criticisms, it is important to note that Kaplan's systems approach does contain valuable insights and ideas that are worth considering. His concept of balance of power for example, is still widely used in international relations to understand the behavior of states.

In conclusion, while Kaplan's systems approach may provide a theoretical framework for understanding international politics, it has been criticized for not capturing the complexities and nuances of real-world international politics, and for lacking analytical or explanatory importance. However, Kaplan's models may still be valuable in some context and need to be considered in the light of the latest development in international relations.

1.  Kaplan's models do not capture the complexities and nuances of real-world international politics.
2.  Some models are hypothetical and do not reflect current international politics.
3.  Models are outdated and do not take into account changes in the international political landscape.
4.  Kaplan's models lack analytical or explanatory importance.
5.  Models fail to explain the environment, structures, functions, input-output processes and the role of domestic variables in international politics.
6.  Models do not fulfill even the basic requirements of systems theory.
7.  Kaplan's models are not relevant to the ultimate goal of international relations, which is to establish peace.

 The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on international politics: Kaplan's models do not take into account the impact of pandemics on international relations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant economic, social and political impacts on countries around the world, and has highlighted the interconnectedness and interdependence of global systems.
