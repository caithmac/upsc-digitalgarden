# Realism 
- Political Realism 
- Devoid of wishful thinking and delued moralising 
- Global Politics is first and last about power and self interest. 
- It is often portrayed as power politics. 
>[!quote]
>Hans Morgenthau  put it, ‘Politics is a struggle for power over men, and whatever its ultimate aim may be, power is its immediate goal and the modes of acquiring, maintaining and demonstrating it determine the technique of political action’.
- Theory of power politics is based on two core assumptions 
	- People are selfish and competitive - egoism
	- State system - context of international anarchy - that there is no authority higher than the soverign state. 
- Egoism + Anarchy = Power Politics 
- Classical realism - explains power politics in terms of egoism 
- Neorealism - explains power politics in terms of anarchy
The key themes within realism are as follows
- State egoism and conflict
- Statecraft and the national interest
- International anarchy and its implications 
- Polarity, stability and the balance of power

## State Egoism and Conflict 
- Important figues 
	- Thucydides
	- Sun Tzu
	- Machiavelli 
	- Thomas Hobbes
- Realist accept that no form of world government can ever be established. 
- Politics is conducted within what is, in effect an international "state of nature"
- Therefore state is a dangerous and uncertain arena. 
- Order and stability being exception rather rule. 
- Their theory are state centric. 
- The fact that the states are composed of  and led by people who are inherently selfish, greedy and power seeking

>Morgenthau (1962) put it, ‘the social world [is] but a projection of human nature onto the collective plane’.

- As each state is self interested actors, the ultimate concern of each state is for survival. 
- Therfore the first priority of its leaders - (Jaishankar, and his diplomacy)
- State pursues security through the use of military or strategic means, and where possible seek to gain advantage at the expense of other states, international politics is characterised by an irresistible tendency towards conflicts. 

## Statecraft and national interest 
- Realist give way to understand international politics from an objective or "scientific" standpoint 
-  Acknowledges important role played by statecraft. 
-  They place an emphasis on "art of statecraft"
- Practical conduct of politics should nevertheless be informed by the six principles of political realism, spelled out as follows :
	- Politics is governed by Objective Law- root in human nature.
	- Key to understanding is concept of interest defined in terms of power.
	- Forms and nature of state power will vary in time, place and context - but concept of intereset remains consistent. 
	- Universal Moral Principles do not guide state behaviour 
	- Moral aspiration are nation specific - no universal moral specific aspiration 
	- The political power is autonomous - key question is - ‘How does this policy affect the power of the nation?’

- Key guide for them is - concern about national interest 
- Realism is portrayed as essentially amoral because it presents human as
	- Lustfull 
	- Power seeking creatures
- State should be guided by wellbeing of its citizen 
- Do not reject - nationally based conception of political morality 
- Do reject - Universal moral principles that supposdly apply to all states in all circumstance. 
- Realism is usually associated with endless war - they are of the view that war should be only fought if vital national interest are at stake. 
-  Realists have also been amongst the most trenchant critics of the ‘war on terror'

## Anarchy and its implication 
- Keneth Waltz's The theory of International Politics
- Three level of analysis 
	- Human individual 
	- State 
	- International system 
- Was critical of classic realism 
- Which had limitation of endogenous or inside-out theory 
- Using system theory - neorealism - structural realism - explains the behaviour of states in term of structure of international system. 
- Neorealism is exogenous - outside-in. 
- Shifts attention from state to international life stem. 
- Neorealist argue that international anarchy tends toward conflict rather than cooperation. 
- Gives three reason 
	- Self-help : As state are separate and autonomus. They rely on themselves  for all their resources.
