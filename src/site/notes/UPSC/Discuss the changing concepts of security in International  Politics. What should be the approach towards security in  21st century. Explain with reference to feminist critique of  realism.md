Introduction:

-   Concepts of security in international politics have traditionally been defined in terms of the protection of the state and its territorial integrity from external threats. However, as Ole Waever, the developer of securitization theory, argues, security is not an objective reality, but rather a social construct that is defined and prioritized by political actors.

Changing Concepts of Security in International Politics:

-   Recognition of limitations of traditional approach in addressing 21st century security challenges. Non-traditional security issues such as human security, environmental security, and economic security are becoming increasingly important in ensuring comprehensive security.
-   According to "Critical security studies" theory, traditional approaches to security neglect the perspectives and needs of marginalized groups, such as women, and calls for a more inclusive and democratic approach to security that takes into account the diverse needs and perspectives of different groups.

Approach towards Security in the 21st Century:

-   Shift away from narrow focus on state security and military force, as emphasized by the "responsibility to protect" principle.
-   Emphasis on diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian tools to address security challenges, as suggested by "human security" concept.
-   Active engagement of marginalized groups in security policy-making process is crucial in ensuring that their needs and perspectives are taken into account.

Feminist Critique of Realism:

-   Traditional approaches to security, as espoused by realism and the works of scholars such as Kenneth Waltz and Hans Morgenthau, neglect the security needs of marginalized groups such as women and children and prioritize the interests of men in positions of power.
-   Feminist security studies, developed by scholars such as J. Ann Tickner and Cynthia Enloe, highlights the ways in which traditional approaches to security have neglected the security needs of women and calls for a more gender-sensitive approach to security.
-   By considering the feminist critique of realism, the approach towards security in the 21st century should include a gender perspective and strive to empower women and other marginalized groups through concepts such as "mainstreaming gender" and "feminist security governance."
-   It is important to note that the traditional realist perspective has been criticized for its androcentric approach and lack of attention to the experiences of women and other marginalized groups in the security studies.

Conclusion:

-   The changing concepts of security in international politics and the need for a more comprehensive and inclusive approach that takes into account the diverse needs and perspectives of different groups, as suggested by "Securitization theory", "Human security" concept, "Critical security studies" and "Feminist security studies".
