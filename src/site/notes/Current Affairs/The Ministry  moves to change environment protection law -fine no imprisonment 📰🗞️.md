The ministry has proposed to replace imprisonment with monetary penalty for the “less severe” contraventions under the EPA, an overarching law that supersedes other environment laws such as the Water and Air Act, which will also be decriminalized.

The amendments also propose the creation of an “Environmental Protection Fund’’ in which the amount of penalty will be remitted.
