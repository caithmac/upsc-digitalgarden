Therefore it is necessary to treat them differently. Will Kimlicka further argued that there is difference in the nature,desire,requirement and demand of these group for immigrants there should be attempt to integration in mainstream of life, so they are entitled for poly ethenic right which facilitates accomodation and integration.
This integration must not be forceful but it should be gradual and on fair terms.
