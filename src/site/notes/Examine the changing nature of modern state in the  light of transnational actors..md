The modern state, as traditionally defined, is a sovereign entity that has the power to govern within its own territorial borders. However, in recent years, the nature of the modern state has been challenged by the rise of transnational actors. Transnational actors, such as multinational corporations, international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and transnational criminal organizations, have increasingly played a role in shaping global governance and domestic politics. 

Transnational actors have had a significant impact on global trade policies and agreements. Multinational corporations, for example, have the power to shape international trade through their economic influence. Scholars like Susan Strange have highlighted the role of these corporations in shaping the international order. They argue that the power of multinational corporations has led to a shift in the balance of power away from states and towards these non-state actors.

International organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, have also had a significant impact on domestic politics. Scholars like Anne-Marie Slaughter have shown how these organizations have led to a shift in the nature of state sovereignty. They argue that the increasing power of international organizations has led to a decline in the traditional concept of state sovereignty and an increase in the authority of these organizations in domestic affairs.

NGOs, such as Amnesty International and Greenpeace, have also become increasingly influential in shaping global governance and domestic policy. Scholars like Robert Keohane have demonstrated how non-state actors have become increasingly influential in shaping global governance. They argue that the increasing power of NGOs has led to a decline in the power of the state to govern effectively.

Transnational criminal organizations have also had a significant impact on the state. Scholars like Saskia Sassen have argued that the rise of transnational actors has led to a decline in the power of the state to govern effectively. They argue that the increasing power of transnational criminal organizations has led to a decline in state sovereignty and an increase in the authority of these organizations in domestic affairs.

An example of the impact of transnational actors on the modern state can be seen in the case of China and multinational corporations. China has become one of the world's leading manufacturers, and multinational corporations have played a significant role in this economic growth. These corporations have shaped China's trade policies and have led to a shift in the balance of power away from the state and towards these non-state actors.

In conclusion, the nature of the modern state has been challenged by the rise of transnational actors. Transnational actors, such as multinational corporations, international organizations, NGOs, and transnational criminal organizations, have increasingly played a role in shaping global governance and domestic politics. Their power and influence have led to a shift in the traditional concept of state sovereignty and an increase in the authority of these non-state actors in domestic affairs. The increasing power of transnational actors has important implications for the future of the modern state and the way it governs. Further research is needed to fully understand the changing nature of the modern state in the light of transnational actors.
