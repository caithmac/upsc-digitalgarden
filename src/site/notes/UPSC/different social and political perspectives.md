## Major debates
On Nature of political system 
- Modernists like Nehru and [[UPSC/B.R. Ambedkar|B.R. Ambedkar]] preferred Parliamentary Democracy.
- Whereas Gandhians preferred Panchayati Raj System 
- However Modernists won and Gandhian got place in Part IV
On Nature of Fedration 
- Hindu Mahasabha and others preferred loose fedration 
- Wheras Nehru and Patel won over who preferred stronger states. 
- This has resulted into highly centralised federation often termed as quasi-fedral. 
- Nehru - Parliamentary System 
- Hindu Mahasabha - Presedential System 
On system of Election 
- Minority demanded separate electorate. 
- Patel and GB Pant strongly opposed. 
On UCC 
- One of the most debated issue. 
- Minority members were against it 
- Women favoured. 
On Fundamental rights. 
- Elaborate debates
- Longest has been on Right to Property
On DPSP 
- NG Ranga, Jaypal Singh, Ambedkar wanted gauranteed rights found in Part IV 
On Judiciary
- CA did consider the system of appointment of Judge by Judges for the sake of independence, 
- Ambedkar on the ground that there can be "No imperium in Imperio", no state within states. 
- Needs checks and balances
On Institution of Governor
- Pt. Thakur Das Bhargava recommended Nehru to make elaborate provision on qualification of governor rather than leaving with some conventions

Thus CA has adopted different provisions after elaborate debates and with consesus . We should appreciate the wisdom of members of CA. 
- Constitution is work in progress. 
- An organic document
- It is mine of rigidty and flexibility
