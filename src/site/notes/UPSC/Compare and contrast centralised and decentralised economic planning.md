# Centralised
Centralized economic planning in India refers to the planning and decision-making process that is carried out by the central government and its agencies, such as the Ministry of Finance and the Planning Commission. This approach involves the government setting targets for economic growth, allocation of resources, and distribution of wealth, and implementing policies and programs to achieve these goals.

"The centralised planning system in India has been successful in achieving a high rate of economic growth and in reducing poverty, but it has also resulted in a number of problems, including inefficiencies, rigidities, and inequities." (Rao, M. Govinda. "Decentralisation in India: A Review." Economic and Political Weekly, vol. 35, no. 45, 2000)

"Centralised planning has the advantage of being able to coordinate resources and set national priorities, but it can also be inflexible and slow to respond to local needs. Decentralised planning, on the other hand, has the advantage of being more responsive to local conditions, but it can also be less efficient and less effective in achieving national goals." (Garg, Ravi. "Centralised versus Decentralised Planning in India: A Comparative Analysis." Economic and Political Weekly, vol. 41, no. 5, 2006)

Here are a few examples of centralized economic planning in India:

1.  Five-Year Plans: India has a long history of centralized economic planning, dating back to the 1950s when the country adopted a Soviet-style planned economy. The Planning Commission, which was established in 1950, is responsible for developing and implementing Five-Year Plans, which set targets for economic growth and development. These plans outline the priorities and policies of the central government, and they are implemented through a variety of programs and projects at the national and local levels.
    
2.  Public sector enterprises: The central government owns and controls a number of large public sector enterprises, such as state-owned banks, oil and gas companies, and defense manufacturers. These enterprises play a significant role in the economy, and the central government has a high degree of control over their operations and policies.
    
3.  Fiscal and monetary policy: The central government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are responsible for setting fiscal and monetary policies that affect the overall direction of the economy. For example, the central government can raise or lower taxes, and the RBI can adjust interest rates to influence the level of economic activity.
    
4.  National development programs: The central government also implements a number of national development programs, such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) and the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), which are designed to address specific development needs and challenges at the national level. These programs are funded and implemented by the central government, and they often involve a significant degree of centralized planning and decision-making.


# Decentralized

Decentralized economic planning, on the other hand, refers to the process of planning and decision-making that is carried out at the local or regional level, rather than being controlled by the central government. In India, decentralized economic planning is implemented through a system of panchayats, or local self-governments, which are responsible for planning and implementing development projects in their respective regions.

"Decentralisation is a complex process that involves the transfer of powers, functions, responsibilities and resources from the central government to sub-national governments, and from central government agencies to local government agencies." (Rondinelli, John, et al. "Decentralisation in Developing Countries: A Review of Recent Experience." World Bank, 1998)

"Decentralisation is not a panacea for all the problems of development, but it can contribute significantly to the improvement of the quality of governance, the accountability of the state, and the participation of citizens in the decisions that affect their lives." (World Bank. "Decentralisation in India: Opportunities and Challenges." World Bank, 2007)

Here are a few examples of decentralized economic planning in India:

1.  Panchayat raj: This is a system of local self-governance in India that allows for decentralized planning and decision-making at the village or town level. Panchayats are responsible for planning and implementing development projects in their respective areas, such as building roads, schools, and health clinics.
    
2.  Urban local bodies: Urban local bodies, such as municipalities and corporations, are responsible for planning and implementing development projects in urban areas. They have the authority to levy taxes and fees to fund these projects, and they also play a role in regulating land use and providing basic services such as water and sanitation.
    
3.  State planning boards: Each state in India has its own planning board, which is responsible for developing a long-term vision for the state's economic development. The board works closely with local governments and other stakeholders to identify priorities and allocate resources accordingly.
    
4.  Special economic zones: Special economic zones (SEZs) are designated areas where businesses can operate with special tax incentives and other regulatory benefits. SEZs are typically developed and managed by state governments, which have the authority to determine which sectors are eligible for these benefits. This allows for decentralized planning and decision-making within the SEZs, as local governments have more control over the allocation of resources and the regulation of businesses within their boundaries.


# Comparision 

There are several key differences between centralized and decentralized economic planning in India. Centralized economic planning is typically top-down, with decisions being made at the national level and then implemented at the local level. Decentralized economic planning, on the other hand, is bottom-up, with local governments and communities playing a more active role in the planning and implementation process.

Another key difference is the degree of control that the central government has over the economy. In a centralized system, the central government has more control over the allocation of resources and the distribution of wealth, while in a decentralized system, local governments have more control over these processes.

Overall, the main advantage of decentralized economic planning is that it allows for more local control and responsiveness to the needs of specific communities. However, it can also be less efficient, as it may involve duplication of efforts and a lack of coordination between different levels of government
