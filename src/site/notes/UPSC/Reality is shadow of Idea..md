>[!todo]+ Idea is reality - Comment
>In Plato's mind Idea is the reality. For him it is the ultimate truth. He explained that what we sense or know through sensory organ is just reflection of ideas or true reality, it is not real. His argument presented the thought that Ideas are essence of everything which remain constant, permanent and never gets destroyed. Thus it is true reality.  
>He presented this philosophy for the purpose of searching of true knowledge, which was based on Socrates theory of knowledge.  The context of it can be linked to two major events that took place in his lifetime. First, he had to face death of his teacher Socrates. Second, the decline of the Greek state. He blamed both of these events on incompetence of ruler class. So he tried to define knowledge and make it mandatory for ruler class. 
>He explains the philosophy by [[UPSC/Allegory of the Cave|Allegory of the Cave]]. In this story, people mistakenly understand shadow as reality. It is similar to phenomena which happens in real life. This understanding that physical world is temporary and reals of ideas is permanent is crucial for ruling class. Rulers must understand that power, wealth, glory are temporary. Virtue and integrity are permanent.
