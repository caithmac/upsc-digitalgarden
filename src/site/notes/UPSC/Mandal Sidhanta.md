		- India has brought Nepal under its control by 1950 Agreement. However India lost strategic advantage when China occupied Tibet. Tibet was also an ideal buffer zone. 

- Max Weber : [[UPSC/Kautilya\|Kautilya]] is more of Machiavellion than [[Machiavelli\|Machiavelli]]. [[Machiavelli\|Machiavelli]] prince is harmless when compared to [[UPSC/Kautilya\|Kautilya]]'s king.  ^54ab16
