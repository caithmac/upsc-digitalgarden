### Context of the debate 
- Widely assumed that Indians lack political and strategic culture. 
- India is considered as a place of spritual wisdom but not political wisdom. 
- Indians have only made progress in spritual aspects of life ignoring the material aspect of life. 
- Politics this worldy where as Indians have been concerned about the "Other World" 
- Hence, in western world, status of Indian political thought remain contested. 

- However it is not correct to say that Indians lack political thinking 
	- When west describes Indians of lacking political wisdom, it reflects their ethno- centric attitude. 
	- Similarly when west ignores Indian political thinking it can be seen as the western attempt to maintain its cultural hegemony. 
- According to **Prof. V R MEHTA**, the failure of west to recognise Ubduab thought can be because of lack of understanding of Indian way of life by people in west. 
- There is a big difference in outlook of East and West 
	- West thinks in Dichotomous lines. West has made difference between Man and Society; Nature and Culture; Politics and Ethics. 
	- Indians have always looked things in continuity. We have never seprated Man and society, Nature and Culture; Dharam and Dand/ 
- Hence in order to understand IPT and state craft, it is necessary to understand Indian Way of life or the inique way of Indian thinking 
- **Prof. MORRIS JONES*
	- The neglect of Indian pol. thought will result into impoverishment of west. 
- **Max Muller**
	- Acknowledged that nowhere in the world human mind has dealt with various question of life in such a depth as in case of India.
- India has been a source of enlightnment for the world

- **Conclusion*
