he Indian Constitution contains several provisions related to inter-state comity, or the cooperation and coordination between states.

1.  Adjudication of inter-state water disputes: Article 262 of the Constitution provides for the settlement of disputes relating to the use, distribution, and control of interstate rivers and river valleys. The Parliament of India has the power to set up a tribunal or other authority for the adjudication of any dispute or complaint with respect to the use, distribution, or control of the waters of any inter-state river or river valley.

2.  Coordination through inter-state councils: Article 263 of the Constitution provides for the establishment of an Inter-State Council to investigate and discuss any matter of common interest between states and the Union government, and to make recommendations on such matters. The Inter-State Council is headed by the Prime Minister and comprises the Chief Ministers of all states and Union Territories, as well as other Union Ministers and officials.

3.  Mutual recognition of public acts, records, and judicial proceedings: Article 261 of the Constitution provides that the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of any state or Union Territory shall be recognized throughout India, and shall be proved in any court in India by the production of a certified copy issued under the authority of the state or Union Territory concerned.

4.  Freedom of inter-state trade, commerce, and intercourse: Article 301 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of trade, commerce, and intercourse throughout India. It states that there shall be free movement of goods, services, and people throughout India, subject to the provisions of the Constitution.


In addition to these constitutional provisions, the Parliament of India has also established zonal councils to promote inter-state cooperation and coordination. There are five zonal councils in India, covering the Northern, Central, Eastern, Western, and Southern regions of the country. These councils bring together the states and Union Territories in each region to discuss and resolve issues of common concern, and to foster cooperation and coordination between the states.
