Human rights are a fundamental aspect of the human experience, enshrined in international law and embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 

Yet, despite the efforts of the international community, the protection and enforcement of human rights remains a formidable challenge. The United Nations (UN) system has played a significant role in addressing human rights issues, but its effectiveness has been subject to criticism and challenges.

From limited enforcement power, to political considerations and inadequate resources, the UN system faces a number of obstacles in its efforts to protect and enforce human rights. 

1.  Limited enforcement power: One of the key challenges faced by the UN in protecting and enforcing human rights is its limited enforcement power. According to political scientist Jack Donnelly, "The UN has virtually no enforcement power, and therefore depends on the cooperation of states." Despite this, the UN has attempted to address this challenge through various initiatives, such as the Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process, which provides a platform for states to review each other's human rights records.
    
2.  Political considerations: The UN's ability to address human rights violations has been criticized for being influenced by political considerations and the influence of powerful states. As stated by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, "The Security Council has sometimes been reluctant to act when doing so might offend important political or economic interests." To address this challenge, the UN has established the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to serve as an independent voice on human rights issues, and has also created the Human Rights Council as a platform for addressing human rights violations.
    
3.  Lack of resources: The UN's human rights activities have been criticized for being underfunded and under-resourced. As human rights lawyer Louis Joinet observed, "The human rights machinery of the United Nations is hampered by inadequate funding, insufficient staffing, and a lack of political support." To address this challenge, the UN has made efforts to increase funding for its human rights activities, such as through the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights.
    
4.  Inadequate follow-up on recommendations: The UN's human rights mechanisms, such as treaty bodies and special procedures, have been criticized for their lack of follow-up on recommendations made to states. As human rights expert Richard Falk has argued, "The UN human rights machinery has been criticized for being too passive, not having the capacity to follow up on its recommendations and not being sufficiently alert to situations of emergency." To address this challenge, the UN has established the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide technical assistance to states in implementing human rights obligations, and has also created the UPR process as a platform for follow-up on human rights recommendations.
    

These are some of the main challenges faced by the UN in protecting and enforcing human rights, along with some of the criticisms and efforts made to address these challenges.
