- Rights are essentially liberal concept as demand of rights against the state started with the conception of mechanistic theory of state, once it was proved that the state is not divine there comes certain garuntee that the state can not take away the rights.

### Theory of Natural Rights 
- Finds mention in American Declaration of Independence and French Declaration of Rigths of Man and Citizens. 
- Natural rights are described as self evident truth.

-  All fundamental rights are natural rights, but all natural rights are not fundamental rights.

- [[UPSC/Bentham\|Bentham]] completely disregard the theory of natural rights. 
- Real source of rights is the origin of state not nature, 
- For [[UPSC/Bentham\|Bentham]] natural rights are nonsense, nonsense upon stilts. 
- Natural rights are anarchial fallacies. Natural rights are terroristic language. 

## Conservative Theory of rights 
- Rights are product of coustoms and tradition. 
- As per Burk Natural Rights are nothing but metaphysical abstraction it is custom or convention and not nature. 
## [[UPSC/Laski\|Laski]] theory of Rights

- Every state is known as the right it maintains. 
- The performance of state is judged on the basis of contribution it makes to substance of human happiness. 
- Grammar of Politics 
- Rights are claims but these claims are not empty of duties. 
- State should provide socio economic rights first , civil political right later. 
- State should control industry or otherwise industry would control state.
