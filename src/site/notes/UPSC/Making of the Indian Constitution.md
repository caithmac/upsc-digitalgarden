## Legacies of the British rule
#### Why is there legacy of the British?
- According to Bipin Chandra, India didn't start with clean state unlike China. 
- In China there was a communist revolution where as in India there was "Transfer of Power."
- Indian elites had preference to Western Liberal Democratic Political order.
- The legacy of British show the continuing hegemony of the British. 

#### What are the legacies of the British?
1. **Economy** 
   - Even after Independence Indian economy remained colonial. India was still exporter of raw material and importer of the finished product. 
   - It was categorized as state of periphery. 
   - The regional imbalance shows that we have not been able to overcome the impact of colonialism. 
      - Rural Backwardness 
      - Rural Poverty 
      - Failure of land reforms. 
      - Agriculture Crisis
      - Lack of public investment in agriculture. 
   - It all shows that there is no break from colonization 
2. **Indian Society**
   - The continuing conflicts
   - Politics of 
	   - Caste
	   - Religion 
	   - Language
	- Can be seen as  British legacy. 
	- Many contemporary problems have born because of Divide and Rule policy of British, 
	- Indians elites preferred continuity rather change, 
3. **Education** 
   - Production of clerks by rote learning
   - Not the growth of creativity and rationale thinking.
   - Unfortunate that continuation of Macaulay's Education System 
4. **Political System** 
   - [[UPSC/Government of India Act. 1935|Government of India Act. 1935]] became the basis of Indian Constitution which in itself were based on the recommendation of [[UPSC/Simon Commission|Simon Commission]] 
	   - Nature of Indian Federation 
	   - Governor 
	   - Ordinance Making Power 
	   - Emergency Provision 
   - These are all the colonial constitution with the objective to maintain the hold of the Raj 
   - [[Jayprakash Narayan|Jayprakash Narayan]] called for Lok Nitti against Raj Nitti
   - 
5. **Foreign Policy**
   - South Asia remains the least integrated among all the regions barring Arabs. 
   - foreign Policy remain play things in the hand of the Neo-Imperialist Power. 
6. **Burecracy**
   - Continues to manifest colonial character. 
   - Indian elites preferred the continuation of Draconian acts like Preventive Detention Laws.
   - Bureaucracy still thrive under *cloak of secrecy*

Thus India reflects more of a continuation and less of change from the British Raj. 
## Constitution of India
 
- It has been argued that the consitution is neither the product of will of people nor it represents the views of all the section of society, 
- Indian Constitution is *Congress Constitution*
- Constituent Assembly was a one party assembly; Churchill said it was "The assembly of Brahmin"
- Assembly was neither elected by people nor people decided its structure or mode of functioning

#### Evolution of Constituent Assembly.
- [[Gandhi|Gandhi]] promised that Swaraj will not be the 'Free Gift'
- Swaraj is an expression of Indians. 
- In 1934 CWC of INC adopted resolution the constituent assembly will be elected on the basis of Universal Adult Franchise. 
- However in practice
- Constituent Assembly was "Gift of British"
- Was based on the Cabinet Mission Plan which was approved by the British Parliament. 
- Members of Constituent assembly were not directly elected rather indirectly by members of provincial legislative assemblies. 
- In 1946 election for provincial assemblies took place. In the election there was no mandate that these members will also be electing the members of the assembly.
- The entire assembly was not even indirectly elected. The members from princely state were nominated. 
- Also that that only 5% of Indians had the right to vote.
-  Constitution of India was not put to referendum to know the will of people.
- Constitution is called "Lawyers Paradise" because of ambiguity and internal contradictions among different provisions resulting into legal battles and political conflicts. 
- Like, right to equality v/s Right to Practice Religion in Case of UCC
- *Counter argument*
- Above arguments are factually correct . 
- Yet these argument by themselves do not establish that Indian constitution does not reflect the will pf people we can give following arguments
	- Time was not conducive
	- [[UPSC/Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in [[UPSC/Kesavananda Bharti Case|Kesavananda Bharti Case]] has settled the matter wrt will of people. 
	- Though dominated by [[UPSC/Indian National Congress|Indian National Congress]] yet as suggested by Garvin Austin "Congress was India and India was congress. "
	- Congress co-opted members of other parties so that constitution becomes a consensus document. 
	- Majority of provision were adopted by consensus rather voting. 
	- There was extensive debate on all the features
	- Constitution is a unique experiment in the field of Constitutionalism. It is sacrosanct. 
	- Constitution is revolutionary. 
	- It is cosmopolitan constitution.
	- Our constitution is based on universal values of - Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. 
	- Our constitution is from multiple sources. 
	- It is situated at cross currents of the global constituent law. 
	- Like Indian Culture, it is also syncretic and Eclectic
