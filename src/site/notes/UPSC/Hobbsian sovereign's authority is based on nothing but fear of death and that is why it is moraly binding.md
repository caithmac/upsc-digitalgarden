For Hobbes the state of nature is simple to define since it lacks government and there is omnipresent danger to life. As long as a mutually  and morally binding agreement does not take place individuals are destined to live a life of perpetual fear and violence. Hobbes says "The wickedness of bad man also compels good man to have recourse, for their own protection, through virtue of war, which are violence and fraud."
For Hobbes, covenants are the only way out of this diabolical situation, since untill all agree to lay down arms life and liberty of everyone will be in danger. This can be only ensured by mutually and morally binding contract of one with all and all with one.  
Role of fear of death in contract, in the state of nature of Hobbes ensure that the first right any individual will seek will be right
