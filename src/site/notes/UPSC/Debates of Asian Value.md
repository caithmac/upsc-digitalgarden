Asian Value Debate was political ideological debate emmerged in 90s, reinterpreting ideals of human rights. Was mainly intitiated by Mathair Muhammad - Malasian PM and Singapoore PM Lee Kuan . 
This concept became very popular during asian financial crisis. It was realised that asian lack any coherent regional institutional mechanism to deal with crisis. 
Supporters of asian value debate criticised existing human regime for being biased in favour of western culter and society. Human Rights are based on value of individualism, free competion and centred around economic prosperity. 
Asian value supporters argued for reinterpretation of human rights in the context of society, culture and history. They debated to create pan asian identity, which is in contradiction of european ideals of universal right of man. 
They further criticised existing human right regime as a desgin to ensrue underdevelopment of eastern countries. 
Universal Human right regime generated disrespect to eastern culture worldwide. Modern internationl rule, regulation are associated with human right and are facing sanction and criticism around human right issue. 
Asian values were codified in the Bangkok declaration of 1993. Which reemphasisied principal of sovereignity, self determination and  non interference in covil and political right. They included 
- Priority to social harmony 
- Concerned with socio economic prosperity 
- Collective welbeing of the community

Asian value debate although got popularity, it has certain flaw.  
- There is no  common culture of asian country 
- There is high cultural difference among east asian, south asian, west asian countries. 
- All eastern civilisation has certain practices which are considered discriminatory biased - caste system, religous dominance in west asaia
- Amartya Sen argued that basic values of all covilsation are almost same, they are expressed through different cultural practices., "Democracy as universal value" he argued that peace liberty and equality is the core value of all civilsation. 
- Kim Da Jung, Lee Teng Hue = agrues that there is fundamental difference among all asian culture. There is overriding cultural diversity, in fact with argument of asian value there is a design to supress of freedom of speech and freedom of expresion.
