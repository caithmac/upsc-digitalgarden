- As per Marx, class consiousness is automatically generated. Exploitation continue to advance from one mode of production to another mode of production, once exploitation reaches at maximum then consciousness will be generated, as per marx, revolution occurs to resolve contradiction.  If there is no contradiction there will be no revolution. 
- Revolution will occur when forces of production have completely matured and exploitation will be at peak. 
- As per Marx, the sequence and direction of social evolution can not be changed, thus revolution can not be advanced or postponed. 
- During revolution ploteriat class will capture means of production. There will be dictatorship of ploteriat in order to stop counter revolution and it will remain so until and unless communism will be established.

- Marx argued that these intermeditary class are actually divided but these division get surfaced only during struggle. He denied modern stratification approach and argued that classes have meaning only as they are real group in social structure. Here group means interaction among memebers common consciousness and similar type of behaviour in entire group member.

- Traced at later period consider writing as Humanist phase of Marx or Young Marx. 
- Marxist conception of Human essence.  
 ### Theory of Freedom by Marx 
 - A marxist view of freedom is fundamentaly different from captialist  or liberal freedom based on indivualistic freedom.
 - Marx criticsed captialist notion of freedom for disconencting or separating individuals freedom from society. Freedom is private acquistion of an isolated person. 
 - Liberal notion of freedom has nothing to do with inner aspect of human being. That is more connected with outer factor of wealth status and luxirious life. 
 - From marxist perpective freedom is essentially a associated with humanist philosophy. Freedom consist of not only the material satisfaction of human need but removing the conditions of de-humanization and alienation. 
 - Marxist believe that freedom has individualistic aspect, social aspect and it is also essentially associated with nature and forces of nature. 
 - Marxist freedom talks about moving out from freeedom of necisty. Marx explain that man can acquire scientific knowledge of natures law and make these laws work towards end of emanicaption of human society. 
 - Marxist revolution can only make people to take a leap from kingdom of nesceiety to kingdom of freedom. Human essence could be only realised only when the captialism will be routed out and communism is established.
