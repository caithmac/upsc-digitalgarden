##### Why Plato is incorrect on Property 
- [[UPSC/Plato|Plato]] failed to make a balance between 
	- Production 
	- Distribution 

- Here he sugested three models for utiisation of property and he claimed it make a balance between production and distribution 
	1. Property owned by individual and utilised by individual 
		- It is most dangerous thing, leads to corruption 
		- Concentration of wealth, root cause of revolution 
	2. Common ownership and individual use
		- It leads to conflict and fractionism 
		- Completely destroys basic fabric of society 
			- Cooperation and Harmony 
		- Most irresponsible way of utilising way of property 
	3. Common property and common use
		- Impractical 
		- Social conflict 
	4. **Individual ownership and common use**
		- Accepted this form
	

- Aristotle says; Property ought to be genrally and in the main private but common in use
- Aristotle at the same time put certain restriction on way of earning and property 
	- Property has to be acquired though honest means 
	- He is dead against taking interest for loan aid or debt
	- he considered it as a most unatural method 
	- He identified agricultural practises and genral trade and services within tereitory of state is best way of acquiring property 
	- he didnt praise earning wealth through across the countr(he advissed people as well as king aware of such traders)
	- He is also against piling or acquiring huge amount of wealth; He says: 
	> To acquire too much property will be a gross error as to make hammer too heavy
