##### Liberty and Equality as opposed to each other
- Ideas given by [[UPSC/Classic Liberalism|Classic Liberalism]] which believe the two value are opposite to each other. 
- Lord Acton and Alexis de Tocqueville; Liberty and equality are antithetical. They believed that desire of equality will destroy the possibility of liberty. 
- The idea of free market and open competion and invisible hand result in a benevolent and progressive outcome tho unequal. 
- They believed that any attempt to remove inequality will involve considerable social and political intervention eventually interfering with individual and his private exercise for freedom. 
- No individual will voluntarily give up its wealth and privileges therefore forceful intervention becomes a compulsory phenomena. It is the wrong for the state to interfere in life and liberty of citizens. 
- Programmes to secure social equality will require massive social and political regulation eventually culminating the state into a totalitarian and authroritian regime. 
- This theory has been supported by Nozzick, Bagehot, Hayek,, Friedman, Mosca, Spencer and Pareto. 
- Hayek believes the pursuit of equality has in practice led to inequality and tyranny this is not mere accident. It is the direct result of condition which are inherent in the very concept of equality. 

##### Liberty and equality as complimentary value
- Positive Liberals viewed the values as complimentary and delegated the task of correcting the socio economic inequalities through legislation and regulation. 
- They believed that individual should be in cooperative social relationship with his social environment 
- They focus on equality of opportunity and to provide such opportunity delibretade social restraints need to be placed on individual freedom.
- Liberty demands that no one should be at mercy of others. By securing equal opportunity for everyone liberty makes equality real which otherwise would be just dull uniformity. 
- Similarly society with gorss inequality can not provide liberty to its citizen. Inequality eventually and always threaten liberty. 
- The presence of both values in a complimentary relationship is a essential conddition for realisation of substantive justice.
- Both values have common end that is promotion of individual personality and its further spontaneous development.
