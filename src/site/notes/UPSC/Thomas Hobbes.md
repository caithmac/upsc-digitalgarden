	- Supreme authority to make laws and to enforce law. 
	- In medieval time; authority was federal. No one knew who was supreme. 
	- Whose law will prevail. So there was chaos. 
- No restrictions over sovereignty 
- [[UPSC/The Leviathan\|The Leviathan]] power can not be transfer to anyone. 
- Sovereign is internally and externally most powerful.

- Essentially lies in power of determining on behalf of community what needs to be done to promote peace and order to promote welfare. 
- All men apart from sovereign becomes its subject.
- Sovereignty is its absoluteness. Ultimate source of law. Sole interpreter. Divine laws are not applicable over sovereign although he accepted existence but sovereign is the sole interpreter.

##### Hobbes's Liberty
> Liberty is where law is silent

- Extreme liberty results into anarchy. 

> Liberty signifies properly the absence of opposition in external impediments to motion. 
- Hobbs has provided justification to the absolute authority of the state. 
- Preference of security over liberty. 
- Man has no liberty where state has made laws

> Liberty in proper sense is absence of law.
