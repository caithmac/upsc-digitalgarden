Civic culture is a concept in political science that refers to the values, beliefs, and attitudes of citizens that shape their involvement in political life. It is often used to describe the degree to which citizens in a particular society are politically active, informed, and engaged. The concept of civic culture was developed by political scientist Gabriel Almond and Sydney Verba in the 1960s as a way to understand the differences in political systems between countries.

According to Almond and  Verba, a strong civic culture is characterized by high levels of political participation, trust in government and political institutions, and a shared sense of civic responsibility among citizens. On the other hand, a weak civic culture is marked by low levels of political participation, mistrust in government and political institutions, and a lack of shared civic values.

The concept of civic culture has been widely used in comparative politics to study and compare the political systems of different countries. It has also been used to analyze the factors that contribute to the development of strong or weak civic cultures in different societies. For example, research has shown that countries with strong civic cultures tend to have more stable and effective democratic systems, while countries with weak civic cultures may be more prone to political instability and authoritarianism.

Overall, the concept of civic culture is an important one in the field of comparative politics and has helped to deepen our understanding of the factors that influence political participation and engagement among citizens in different societies.
