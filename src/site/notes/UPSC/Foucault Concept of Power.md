##### Discipline 
- Foucault argues that discipline is mechanism of power that regulates thought and behavior of social actor through subtle means. It works by organizing space, time and everyday activity. Surveliance is also an integral part of disciplinary practice. In '"Punishment and Discipline"' he argues that modern society is disciplanry society. Power in our time is largely exercised through disciplinary means in variety of institution. 

##### Body 
- He is particularly concerned with relation between political power and body  and describes varous historical way to train body to make it socialy productive. The body is an element to be managed in relation to strategies of economic and social management of population. 

##### Confesssion 
- He says that religious practice of confession were method to make people confess to their innermost desire and sexual practices. These confession then becomes data for social science to construct mechanism of social control.

##### Culture 
- He describes culture as heirachal organisation of values, acessible to everbody, but at the same time the ocasion a mechanism of selection and exclusion. 

##### Identity 
- He sees identity as form of subjugation and a way of exercising power over people and preventing them outside fixed boundary. 
- He himself favours disolution of identity rather than creation or maintance.

##### Institution
- He notes that instituion are a way of freezing particular relation of power so that certain number of people are advantaged. 

##### Morality and moral system. 
- Set of values and rules for action which are proposed to individual by diverse institutuion such as family education system or churches. He argues that good is something that is practised not discovered. 
 
##### Power 
- Not a thing but a relation. Power is not simply represive but it constructive too. 
- Power is not simply property of state. Power is not something that is excluvily localised in govt and state. Rather power is exercised throughout social body.
- Power operates at most micro level of social relation. 
- Power is omnipresent at every level of social body, power is not personalised but instituionlised, it belongs to institution. 
- His model is known as capilary model of power. In which he attempted to understand relations of power looking at struggle and resistance. 
- He moves from the soveriegnity conception of power towards what he calls disciplinary power or micromechanism of power - the techniques and tactics of domination - that, as closely linked grid of disciplinary, keep the social body in steady state.  
- According to him power is not just negative, coercive or rerepresive thing, that forces us to do things against our wishes but also can be necessarym, productive and positive force in society. 
- There are many types of power he identified. According to him, physicall bodies are subjugated and made to behave in a certain ways, as microsm of social control of the wider population through what he called biopower. Disciplinary and biopower ceates discursive practice or body of knowledge and behaviour that defines what is normal, acceptable, deviant etc. But it is discursive practise that is in constant flux. 
- His approach to power is that it transcends politics and sees power as everyday, socialised embodied phenomena. That is why state centre power struggle including revolution do not always lead to change in the social order. 

##### Knowledge is Power. 
- He uses the term,, to signify that power is constituted through accepted form of knowledge, scientific knowledge and truth, in this conncection he narrates that power is everywhere and comes from everywhere in this sense (power) is neither an agency nor structure it is kind of meta power or regime of truth pervades society and which is in constant flux and negotiotaion. 
- He noted that truth and knowledge in this world is only produced by virtue of multiple form of constraint. 
- Each society has its regime of  truth that is type of discourse which accepts make function as true: the mechanism and instances which enable one to distinguishes true and false statement. 
- Paul Rabinow - Identified three models of objectification in writing of FOucalt. In other words three models of organising principle used by foucault to explain how human being becomes subjects. 
	- Dividing Practise 
		- Involves exclusion of people who are precieved as threat to community. 
		- It was believed that threat to society could be solved through exclusion. Theives into prision, "==ships of fool=="
	- Scientific 
		- The enlightment brought new sciences which were concerned with understanding of human nature. These termed what is normal so abnormal could be treated. 
		- The key tool for new science was examination. This tool transformed visiblity into power, classifed people into cases and trapped them into straight jacket of documentation.
	- Subjectification
		- Self formation, self understanding and the way in which conformity is achieved. 
		- He is concerned with self formation and self understanding categorised person, normal or abnormal and normality is tested in relation to a number of factor.
