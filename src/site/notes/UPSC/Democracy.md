# Democracy
- Democracy is considered best practicable form of government in narrow sense it is form of government based on people's participation in broad sense it is value system and way of life. 
- The government approach is centered on electoral procedure, accountability and good government. 

Democracy as value system has been commented by
- [[UPSC/Amartya Sen\|Amartya Sen]] 
> Democracy has instrumental value, educative value and intrinsic value. 

- [[UPSC/B.R. Ambedkar\|B.R. Ambedkar]] on the other hand believed that 
> Democracy is just top soil of India. India has political democracy but no socio economic equality. One man one vote is not sufficient there has to be one man one value.
 
Democracy first arrived in west European countries and was called 'First Wave' as per [[Huntington\|Huntington]]. 
- The reversal of first wave happens with rise of totalitarian ideology, [[UPSC/Fascism\|Fascism]], [[Nazism\|Nazism]] and Stanlism.

- With collapse of communism in eastern Europe democracy acquired universal status.
- Arab spring was expected to be the 4th wave but geopolitical power play resulted in its failure. 

#### Why do you think democracy survived in india? 
- Legacy of national movement
- Congress as the main agency of political socialization
- Democratic leaders and democratic succession. 
- Strict separation between civilian and military administration 
- India followed Non alignment 
- Christoher Jefferlot, Indian democracy remains procedural and is far from perfect. He points at the use of money and muscle power and argues that India has long way to go to become substantive democracy.

#### Critique of Mcpherson
- Doesnt provide methods to implement the idea. 
- His theory can be used as an execuse to oppress minority views since he does not define what comes under extractive power or developmental 
- Western scholars have been criticesed by proponent [[UPSC/Debates of Asian Value\|Debates of Asian Value]] on the ground that [[UPSC/Democracy\|Democracy]] is only obsession of western society and it is not compatible with asian value system. 
- [[UPSC/Amartya Sen\|Amartya Sen]] talks about capability approach - for him defining crietria of democracy is fulfilment of capibility of individual. He rejects asian value thesis by arguing that asia itself doesn't any have any uniform value.

## Model of Democracy
1. **Representative Government**
	- [[UPSC/John Locke\|John Locke]] was the cheif proponent representative government. 
	- [[UPSC/John S. Mill\|John S. Mill]] in his book representive government argues that representative government is second best government. 
	- One of biggest issue of RD is to ensure uniform and equitable representation.
	- [[UPSC/John S. Mill\|John S. Mill]] was fearful of tyranny of majority therefore he suggested multiple reforms in the idea such as plural voting, open ballet.
	- RD has two model of representation 
		- Delegate Model - Where representatives are not given any freedom to take decision, they stick to public mandate. Given by [[UPSC/John Locke\|John Locke]] and [[UPSC/Bentham\|Bentham]]
		- Enlightenment Model - Where representatives have more experience than public therefore more flexibility in decision making 
		- [[UPSC/Rousseau\|Rousseau]] criticizes RD by saying Englishmen are free only once in 5 years. 
		- [[UPSC/Gandhi\|Gandhi]] , [[UPSC/M.N. Roy\|M.N. Roy]] , [[Jayprakash Narayan\|Jayprakash Narayan]] supported party less democracy. 
		- As a alternative of RD, participatory or direct democracy was floated.  
2. **Direct Democracy** 
	- The idea of Direct Democracy starts from [[UPSC/Aristotle\|Aristotle]] but he takes a very narrow view on participation. 
	- [[UPSC/Rousseau\|Rousseau]] brings the idea of general will to conduct direct democracy. But the idea itself has been criticsed on the grounds of being totalitarian and majoritarian.

3. **Radical Democracy** 
	- Thinkers like [[Habermas\|Habermas]], Ernest Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, Nancy Fraser, Seyla Benhabib talk about the idea of radical democracy.
	- the only basis to treat a party or association as truly participative is when it fulfils the following condition this maxim was known as ideal speech situation. 
		- When there is no force excepts force of  arguments. 
		- Where all have equal right to speak
		- Whatever ideas are expressed they are pure and honest. 
		- This is followed by the idea of comunicative action where individuals in ideal speech situation are understanding each other and are accountable to each other. 
		- Nancy Fraser extends this idea to subaltern(marginalised) classes and argues that they should have their own sphere of communication. This sub sphere was contra public. 
4. **Deliberative Democracy**
	- Joshua Cohen talks about deliberative democracy as per him its an independent and ongoing association of people with continuity of participation. 
	- It has to be accepted that for arriving at decision deliberation is the only method. 
	- There should be a non coercive and difference of opinion should be respected. Deliberation than would provide legitimacy 
	- Deliberative democracy allows development of trust in the system, has educative value. 
	- Deliberative democracy has consocitional value and substantive impact that is it transisons the procedural democracy to substantive democracy. 
	- Deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting
	- 
	- [[Discuss the interelationship between participatory and delibrative deomcracy. Ellaborate with example and explain how they are two sides of coin.\|Discuss the interelationship between participatory and delibrative deomcracy. Ellaborate with example and explain how they are two sides of coin.]] 
5. **Procedural and Substantive Democracy**
	- **procedural dimension** merely focuses on procedures or means in place to attain democracy
	- Schumpeter  has said that democracy is "institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people’s vote"
	- Huntington has also echoed similar views saying, “The central procedure of democracy is the selection of leaders through competitive elections by the people they govern
	- People are perceived as passive beyond electoral participation in procedural view and thus are governed by their representatives. 
	- view does not focus on liberty and freedom as it emphasizes how to elect a democratic government.
	- fallacy of electoralism : a situation where electoral process is given priority over other dimensions of democracy
	- Fareed Zakaria calls it ‘illiberal democracy’, a case where governments are democratically elected but ignore constitutional limits on their power and deprive their citizens of basic rights and freedoms
	- **Substantive democracy** overcome the shortcomings of procedural view arguing that social and economic differences could hamper people’s participation in the democratic process
	- it talks about ‘common good’ rather than benefit of limited individuals
	- The rights of marginalized sections like women and the poor are protected through redistributive justice so that conditions can be created through state intervention for their participation in political process.
