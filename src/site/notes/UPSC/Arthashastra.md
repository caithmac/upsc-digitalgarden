- Arthshastra belongs to the tradition of Dandashastraa 
- Prime issue : State craft 
- However it also discusses Dharma and we see the continuity between Manu and Kautilya

### Main Idea of Kautilya 
-  Kautilya defines state craft as Arthshastra. 
- Arth denotes material well being. 
- According to him the most important objective of the king is to serve material well being of his people. 
> Material well being is supreme, attainment of all other goals - Dharm, Kama Miksha depends on material well being. 
- In ancient times, Land was the main source of securing material well being. 

- ##### How to acquire new land 
	- It is natural for the state to go for acquiring land. The 1st land to be acquired is the land of neighbour. 
	- Hence, neighbours are natural enemies. 
	- Hence, the relations b/w 2 state are the relation of war. Thus Arthshastra deals with Art of War like Sun Tzu, 

- ##### War, strategies, planning. Balance of power, Geo politics
	- [[UPSC/Arthashastra|Arthashastra]] can be considered as first book on geo-politics
	- Geopolitics - Science of capturing land
	- According to concept of geopolitics, land state is an organism like any organism, state has to grow. 
	- If state does not grow/expand, state will perish/decay thus Arthshastra challenge the western view that Indians lacked strategic culture. 
	- **George Tanham** categorically rejected that Indians had any strategic culture. wisdom. 
	- But Kutilya proves him wrong
