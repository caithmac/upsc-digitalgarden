- Price of crude impact the cost of essential goods like food and clothing since every good that we access daily has been transported long distance
- Ramification of Russia's Invasion of Ukraine
- a significant fall out of Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been the rising cost of the petroleum Russia is the world's largest exporter of oil products to global markets and the second largest exporter of crude oil behind Saudi Arabia. Western countries including the United States and Europe, have imposed an array of sanctions against Russia. Europe and the United states have seen the price of oil steadily rise after they reduced their purchase from Russia.
- How India and Other countries responded 
- India and other hand has chosen a different route we have increased a purchase of Russian oil to cope with rising oil prices elsewhere. India has increased imports of Russian crude more than 25 fold since the start of the invasion. India is importing an average of 1,000,000 barrels a day. India's behavior is governed by our best interest which is the most important element of any execute foreign and economic policy. We have historically imported oil and crude from Iran, Iraq and Russia countries that have been precariously placed either due to war or sanction. China's imports of Russian oil rose 28% while europe's rushing crude purchase fell by 5 million barrels a day. Pencil Russia has not suffered a significant loss in terms of crude oil sales. Countries like India China and Turkey the time increasing their oil purchases from Russia have six months to find a work around to the insurance bind by using a non European insurance companies.

India cannot afford to be dependent on an unhindered supply for electric batteries from China, given geopolitical consideration and border dispute between the two nations period to whether the new electric era that will no doubt be noted within territorial walls and national security concerns
- what the invasion of Ukraine has taught us is that we need to be more self-reliant and have in-house energy sources
